                        <h1>Week 9</h1>
                        <h3>TPC Elite</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>The year of TPC continues. Scott & James had never been better than 5-3 after 8 weeks (5-3 in 2011 and 2016), yet they find themselves at 7-1 and one week away from locking up a playoff berth. They've also got to be the odds on favorites to land an invaluable playoff bye. TPC leads the league with a robust 137.8 PPG and rides a 4-game winning streak.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Week 8 was the third highest scoring week of the season. The Butlers were unlucky enough to post their second score of 120+ and earn 0 League Cup Points. Matt & Ross now have the #1 and #3 highest weekly scores that have received 0 FHLC Points.</p>

<br></br>
<p>DTTW was on a tear to start the season and looked poised to for a franchise-best in multiple categories. The subsequent 3-game losing streak has brought that talk to an abrupt halt, and more concerningly, brought Crockett to within one game of DTTW. What seemed like a sure bet earlier this month is now in jeopardy of going either way.</p>

<br></br>
<p>In the hypothetical retrospective MWM semi-finals last week, Mitch would have beaten Joseph & Mike and Matt & Ross would have beaten Doug. We would have had ourselves a Mitch vs Matt & Ross MWM 2019 Stage Final this week to enjoy. Can't wait for week 9 next year ... Playoff race heating up + MWM Stage Final + FHLC Table taking shape </p>

<br></br>
<h3>Major Competitions</h3>
<p>The best way of visualizing the four competitions is by visiting the <a href="/competitions">competitions</a> page on a non-mobile device. We have a Playoff Championship <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i>, Marathon <i id="icons" class="fas fa-award"></i>, League Cup <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i>, and a Community Shield <i id="icons" class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>.</p>

            <h5>Week 9</h5>
            <p>TPC has tentatively punched its ticket to the Playoffs. Although the extreme bottom-feeders have created room for an extra two teams in the middle tier of Playoff contenders, so it's possible that at least one 7-win franchise gets left out of the Playoffs. TPC has a 100+ point lead on the 4-4 contenders though, so they'll squeak out any tiebreakers if they maintain this scoring pace.</p>
            <p>Despite its poor start to the season, the staff here at KyleLogic.com has been steadfast in its opinion that the Blake roster sure looks like a Playoff contender. Blake faced the most brutal points-against through the first four weeks that the league has ever seen, but reversion to the mean has occurred as expected. The Blake franchise is all the way down to 127.5 PPG-against on the season which is merely middle-of-the-pack in PPG-a this season.</p>
            <p>2017 was the last time Blake was in Playoff contention going into week 9.</p>
            <p>The Matt & Ross franchise is a welcome site near the top of the Playoff Standings, as we haven't had a Butler Playoff showing since 2015.</p>
            <p>There's actually a path for Doug to make the playoffs if he can turn this 6-game losing streak into a 5-game winning streak to end the season. It's a lot to ask.</p>

        <h5>Week 9</h5>
        <p>Scott & James continue to ascend the Table, now a full 3 Points clear of TBH. If not for Matt & Ross' poor luck mentioned earlier, they'd be in the thick of things at the top as well.</p>
        <p>As it stands, Joseph & Mike, Mitch, and Nick & Mickey are likely going to have to be the ones who chase down The Peoples' Choice for a chance to raise the League Cup.</p>
        <p>The middle of the Table has bled into being the bottom of the Table. 8 and 9 FHLC Points seems like such a long way from the top with the way those elite four franchises are performing on a weekly basis.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>Scott & James' Pats D/ST scored 21 points last week, which brought its season average DOWN. Through 7 starts. That's insanity and I can't wait to see just how badly this Pats D/ST ends up shattering our record books this season. Best FAAB pickup of the year by far.</p></li>
    <li><p>Nick & Mickey have posted 130+ PPG through the first 8 weeks during three of their five seasons. Of every other franchise in the league, only Joseph & Mike have accomplished that same feat over the past five seasons. This rivalry is no joke.</p></li>
    <li><p>Mitch's 125.4 PPG is a Modern Era franchise record through 8 weeks.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Mitch franchise has just recorded its highest ever points-scored in a loss, scoring 148.5 in its loss to TPC last week. That beats out its previous record of 146.9 points scored in a loss to ... TPC in 2013.</p></li>
    <li><p>Matt & Ross are off to a great 130.6 PPG start. That's now their Modern Era franchise record through 8 weeks.</p></li>
    <li><p>DTTW's Deshaun Watson put up 35+ in a loss to Blake, and Kmish's Aaron Rodgers put up 35+ in a loss to Nick & Mickey. Franchises are now 104-48 when their QB has a 35+ point performance.</p></li>
    <li><p>As a franchise, Kfish plays in the most lopsided games. This franchise has the highest average absolute value margin at 34.5 points, and true to form, has the second highest absolute value of margin this season so far (39.1 point avg margin)</p></li>
    <li><p>RTRO is facing 133.0 PPG-against. That's the most in Modern History, and the fourth most all-time. We witnessed historically magnificent fantasy D from TBH last season. Now we get to witness historically atrocious fantasy D from RTRO this season.</p></li>
    <li><p>Joseph & Mike's 134.1 is their third highest scoring week in which they've suffered defeat. They lost to Mitch five weeks ago despite scoring 163.7!</p></li>
    <li><p>ZJs have played 71 games over the 5 Modern Era seasons. Guess how many times they've scored more than 140 points ... four times. Less than once per season. They posted their second highest score in Modern Franchise History last week (148.1)</p></li>
    <li><p>The average number of 140+ point weeks per franchise during the Modern Era is just over 14. Gaudet & Cameron and Blake are tied at 4 weeks of 140+ while Kyle has 8. No other franchise is below 12.</p></li>
    <li><p>It's the 12th time being the weekly low scorer for the Doug franchise, although the first time since instituting the new penalty in 2017.</p></li>
    <li><p>It's the 14th time that TPC has been weekly high scorer, and their 3rd time since 2017.</p></li>
    <li><p>#10 in the Playoff Standings heading into week 9 is the worst position the Crockett franchise has ever found itself in. It's the third time in franchise history starting 3-5, and the second consecutive year with that record.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Blake franchise's 4-4 record ties a franchise best through 8 weeks. The 3-game winning streak also ties a franchise best (weeks 11-13 of 2016 and weeks 7-9 of 2017)</p></li>
    
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 9 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Mitch (4-4) vs RTRO (1-7):</h3> Even 1 League Cup Point would keep Mitch in the hunt at the top of the Table. As for the Playoff Standings, ever win is critical down the stretch, especially with the murky tier of 10ish Playoff contenders. I guess Gardner Minshew III will be leading the Mitch franchise into battle. Gotta like his chances.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Gaudet & Cameron (4-4) vs Blake (4-4):</h3> Reeeaaally big Playoff implications here. This is the definition of a stratification matchup. Neither squad has anyone of note on BYE, so we get good on good. Impossible to pick a winner here in what could very well be a playoff prelude.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Doug (2-6) vs Nick & Mickey (5-3):</h3> Doug catches a break this week with Cooper Kupp and Calvin Ridley both on BYEs. The matchups don't look great for Nick & Mickey (Chubb @ DEN, Watkins vs MIN, and Peterson @ BUF stand out), but if they can somehow pull out a W and 3 Points, we'll be looking at Nick & Mickey as a true contender at both the top of the FHLC Table and in the race for a Playoff bye.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Scott & James (7-1) vs Kyle (4-4):</h3> This game couldn't have come at a better time for DTTW. In the midst of a 3-game losing streak, it now gets some reprieve against a Michael Thomas-less TPC. Latavius Murray, the TPC Flex monster from last week is also out on bye. Kyle is projected to win this game, and thus to stay safely positioned in the Playoff hunt for another week.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Kfish (4-4) vs Crockett (3-5):</h3> This will be a battle of the benches. Kamara and Robert Woods are on bye for Kmish while Freeman and Tyler Boyd are on bye for Crockett. The Crockett franchise has somehow avoided Playoff elimination so far, but it almost needs to win out to qualify at this point. With the lowest points-scored in the league, it won't be winning any tiebreakers come week 13.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Joseph & Mike (5-3) vs Matt & Ross (5-3):</h3> Game of the week. We're guaranteed a 6-3 team heading into week 10, and if Nick & Mickey falter without Kupp and Ridley against Doug this week, the winner of this TBH v Butlers matchup will have the inside track to a Playoff bye. TBH has four CRITICAL players all on bye this week (Gurley, Matt Ryan, Hooper, and Cooks!!), so the Butlers have to be the heavy favorites in this one.</p>
