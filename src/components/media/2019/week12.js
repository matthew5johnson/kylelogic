                        <h1>Week 12</h1>
                        <h3>Butler Service</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Congratulations to Matt & Ross who have clinched a Playoff spot. Now they set their sights on snagging a Bye.</p>
<p>The Butlers were #1 in the Playoff Standings after week 1. They've returned once again this week.</p>
<p>We've had four different franchises in the #1 spot this season - Matt & Ross (week 1 and 11), Scott & James (weeks 2-3, 6-10), Mitch (week 4), and Joseph & Mike (week 5).</p>
<p>TPC put in a great run through the middle of the season, but their stumbles could really cost them here lately. Losing to a 2-win RTRO squad is no way to stake your claim to a Playoff Bye. Luckily there's still time, and a mega matchup with Blake looms large in #RivalryWeek. That could be a Playoff Bye elimination game this time next week.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Both Tellarico brothers and both Evers brothers are currently under the Playoff cut line. Blake and Kyle have never made the Playoffs before.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Specific MWM implications at the bottom of the Standings: With the way the Consolation Ladder works, being a bottom two seed is an extreme disadvantage. The winner AND the loser of that first round matchup will both still be elibible to fall back into the Sacko with a loss in round 2. Improving your seeding by just one spot, up to #10 from #11, means that winning your first round matchup makes it impossible to qualify for the Sacko regardless of your outcome in round 2.</p>
<p>Being one of the top 2 seeds in the Consolation Ladder means that you'd have to go on a 3-game losing streak to lose the Sacko. A win at any point saves you.</p>
<p>In summary, being a #11 or #12 seed is like playing in quicksand. Being a #7 or #8 seed is like playing with an extra life. This will be important to keep in mind as franchises jostle for position down the stretch.</p>

<br></br>

            <h5>Week 12</h5>
            <p>Matt & Ross are our first and only Playoff qualifier. TPC and Kyle will both clinch a Playoff spot this week with a win.</p>
            <p>Joseph & Mike and Blake each have 6 wins and 1,400 points, so they're looking very good as it stands. Mitch's 6 wins are great, but his 1,358 points is actually less than Nick & Mickey and just ahead of Kmish. Both of those franchises are within one game of chasing down Mitch and invoking the points-scored tie-breaker.</p>
            <p>The tier below Nick & Mickey and Kmish includes 3 franchises that surprisingly are yet to be mathematically eliminated. They're at a considerable disadvantage since they've all got less than 1,300 points. But miracles happen.</p>

        <h5>Week 12</h5>
        <p>In a week when Joseph & Mike could have used 3 Points, they end up being league low scorer, awarded 0 Points and -$10. TPC loses their head-to-head matchup in brutal fashion, and salvage 1 Point.</p>
        <p>We said last week that whoever can thrive under pressure over these final three weeks would raise the Finch Howe League Cup. Matt & Ross and Mitch each had 15 Points last week to keep them 5 Points off the lead. They each stepped up to the plate and crushed it last week with 3 Point results.</p>
        <p>A paltry 3 Points now separates the top 4 franchises in the Table.</p>
        <p>Kyle and Blake are darkhorses with their 16 Points. Everyone below them has been eliminated from FHLC contention.</p>
        <p>Let the show begin.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>Blake gets 38 from Lamar Jackson, yet fails to win the Tellarico Showdown because of a TyFreek injury.</p></li>
    <li><p>The 1.5 point loss is the closest defeat in Blake franchise history (2 point loss to ZJs in week 10 of last season).</p></li>
    <li><p>Mitch now leads the all-time Tellarico Showdown 4-1.</p></li>
    <li><p>The 1.5 point win ties the closest victory in Mitch franchise history (1.5 win over Nick & Mickey in week 4 of 2016)</p></li>
    <li><p>The Crockett franchise is 5-6 for the second season in a row. It sat at #6 in the Playoff Standings at this point last year, however, and sits at #10 this year. The last time Crockett was #10 this late in the season was 2012 when he notched the franchise worst finish (#7 out of 10).</p></li>
    <li><p>I was excited to dig into Dak's 40.6 point performance. Unfortunately Doug's history with Mahomes, Big Ben, Russ, and Brees pushes Dak's performance all the way down to 10th in franchise history. It's time for a QB wealth tax on the Doug franchise</p></li>
    <li><p>Dating back to 2015, Gaudet & Cameron have faced Kyle nine times. Here are the points scored by Gaudet & Cameron in each of those matchups, in order of '15 to most recent:</p></li>
    <li><p>97.9, 95.9, 107.6, 115.7, 102.6, 106.6, 87.1, 106.4, 112.8</p></li>
    <li><p>This is really really bad. What do you guess their record is in those games? Probably 0-9. Maybe 2-7 at the very best, with wins in the only two games they scored 110+ against Kyle?</p></li>
    <li><p>The answer is 4-5.</p></li>
    <li><p>With the win over TPC, RTRO's all-time greatest losing streak of 8-games is sadly snapped. It's only a tie for the record. A 9-game losing streak would have stood alone.</p></li>
    <li><p>Joseph & Mike suffer a mega defeat by 81.3 points to Kmish. It's the second 80+ point loss in TBH history (84.8 point loss in #RivalryWeek 13 last season)</p></li>
    <li><p>The win only barely cracks Kmish's top-5 biggest blowouts.</p></li>
    <li><p>JimmyG's 44.2 comes in at #7 in Kfish QB franchise history. Aaron Rodgers' 56.3 four weeks ago will be tough to knock off of the top spot in Kfish record books.</p></li>
    <li><p>There's no way this is right ... the Kyle franchise record for longest winning streak is 4 games in a row. He's on a 3-game streak right now, so I guess he can set a new franchise record by the end of the regular season? I'm a bit dubious here, but don't care to dive into the underlyings at the moment.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Butler rampage continues. Since scoring 91.4 and losing in week 2, they have scored 120+ every week and gone 7-2. They haven't scored fewer than 126 points in any game during their current 5-game winning streak.</p></li>
    <li><p>The last time Matt & Ross were in the Playoffs was 2015. They finished third in the league. They've been in the Consolation Ladder for the past three seasons, winning the Ladder twice. They come to play no matter which competition they're in.</p></li>
    <li><p>Nick & Mickey had only scored below 100 seven times over the past 3 regular seasons. They've scored less than 100 four times this season alone, and 97.x in consecutive weeks now.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Nick & Mickey franchise had two very unlucky losses in weeks 3 and 5, scoring 143.6 and 153.1</p></li>
    <li><p>Their current 3-game losing streak is threatening the franchise-worst of five in a row. All of this gloom and they're still solidly in the Playoff hunt.</p></li>
    <li><p>Another 20+ showing from the Pats D would have given TPC the win the week. Alas, 11 points isn't enough to carry their squad. Three game losing streak and the alarm bells are ringing.</p></li>
   
</ul>

<br></br>
<h2>Week 12 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Doug (4-7) vs RTRO (2-9):</h3> Doug needs to escape the quicksand of being a last-two seed. A win would go a long way. RTRO is locked into a last-two seed, so their regular season is over as they now prepare for the Consolation Ladder.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Joseph & Mike (6-5) vs Gaudet & Cameron (5-6):</h3> 3 Points by Joseph & Mike here could end up being enough to hoist the League Cup. A ZJs win would seriously shake up the Playoff cut-line, but that seems like a long shot with Kyler Murray, Travis Kelce, and Kirk all on bye this week. A loss here would certainly put an end to ZJs Playoff hopes.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Kfish (5-6) vs Kyle (7-4):</h3> I'm getting nervous for the Kyle franchise. I've been pulling for DTTW to make the Playoffs for a decade, and this could finally be its shot. A win this week punches Douille's ticket. Of course it has to be the week that Thielen, Ekeler, and Drake are all on bye. Kmish has bye week issues of his own, however, so this game is a tossup. It should shape up to be a QB and RB duel. A Kmish win is imperative to keep Playoff aspirations alive.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Scott & James (7-4) vs Crockett (5-6):</h3> TPC doesn't have the feel of a 7-win team, and Crockett doesn't have the feel of a 5-win team. TPC categorically does not have a Playoff caliber roster and this has clearly started to catch up to them. Fortunately, they're 1 Point clear at the top of the FHLC Table - I'd say their best shot at 2019 hardware is in that Major Competition, and recommend they go all out to secure a Points result this week. They have a ~75% chance of making the Playoffs. As much as it feels like TPC's record doesn't reflect its mediocre roster, that feeling is even more pronounced in the case of the Crockett franchise. Its 108.3 PPG is last in the league yet it somehow remains in Playoff contention. That could end this week with Melvin Gordon and Kirk Cousins on bye, although Jameis Winston has been starting over Cousins while not on bye. That bold strategy cost him a win last week, and potentially a Playoff bid.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Nick & Mickey (5-6) vs Mitch (6-5):</h3> Mitch squeezes out a tight win in the Tellarico Showdown, and enters week 12 having to start Tannehill at QB with Mahomes on bye. Nick & Mickey are starting a guy who I've never heard of at TE. The math in this one is simple: if Nick & Mickey score below 100, they'll lose and almost certainly be eliminated from the Playoffs. If they win, all of the sudden they'll be feeling great about qualification. Mitch will be focused on the League Cup in addition to the head-to-head matchup since he's only 3 Points off the top of the Table.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Blake (6-5) vs Matt & Ross (8-3):</h3> These might be the two best rosters in the league right now. Matt & Ross are scorching hot, and Blake was an unlucky sequence of events away from being a serious Bye contender last week. Even though Tyreek is out for Blake and Diggs is out for Matt & Ross, this should be a fabulous showdown between two Playoff Championship contending teams. Matt & Ross would love 3 Points as they continue to ascend the Table.</p>
