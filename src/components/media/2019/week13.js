                        <h3>#RivalryWeek</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Congratulations to the Kyle franchise for its first ever Playoff qualification! DTTW is now on the biggest stage. Crockett loses his bet and has already paid up. Welcome to the DTTW golden era.</p>
<p>Three franchises have mathematically qualified for the Playoffs: Matt & Ross, Scott & James, and Kyle</p>
<p>Doug and RTRO are the only two that are mathematically eliminated. Kmish and Crockett would need a lot to happen, including to make up a 90 point and 190 point differential to win tiebreakers against the lowest scoring six win teams.</p>
<p>With the late collapse of TPC and TBH and corresponding surge from FHLC contenders, the League Cup Table all of the sudden has 6 franchises that could hoist the Cup at the end of this weekend. The lowest theoretical FHLC winner would have had 25 Points. This year could be the lowest scoring/closest we ever see.</p>

<br></br>
<p>The Butlers lead the league in scoring this season at 132.8 PPG. A Diamond Season (140+ PPG) is probably off the table barring a postseason run for the ages. Blake and Scott & James are each in the 129 PPG range.</p>
<p>The Blake franchise is the only franchise with a Golden Season in tact (no week scoring less than 100 points). If Blake can avoid dipping below 100 in any of the next 4 weeks, it'll be the eighth Golden Season in league history.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Let's go through each #RivalryWeek matchup for League Cup and postseason implications.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Matt & Ross vs Crockett</h4>
<p>Matt & Ross can lock up a Playoff bye in a loss as long as they don't let Kyle outscore them by more than 114 points this week. A Butler win locks them into a bye.</p>
<p>The Butlers are amazingly a single Point off of TPC at the top of the FHLC Table. The FHLC tiebreaker is total fanstasy points scored, which the Butlers hold by 40 points over TPC right now. But Matt & Ross will be jumped by any of the 4 teams below them who post a 3-Point result this week if the Butlers only get a 1-Point result. The FHLC is as good as it gets right now. Matt & Ross could be 3 Points away from winning their first hardware since 2012.</p>
<p>Crockett has to do everything possible to stay in his current #10 seed. A loss coupled with a Doug win this week would move Crockett down to the #11 seed where he would enter Consolation Ladder quicksand that we discussed last week. Avoiding being a bottom-2 seed is critical.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Scott & James vs Blake</h4>
<p>Scott & James have a 72 point advantage over Kyle, but a loss paired with a Kyle win would bump them out of a Playoff bye. They're safely qualified, but that bye is worth its weight in gold.</p>
<p>1 Point clear at the top of the League Cup Table, Scott & James are the only franchise that controls its own destiny. 3 Points wins them the Cup, and their first hardware in franchise history.</p>
<p>Blake could qualify for the Playoffs with a loss, but it would bring the anxiety of tie-breakers into play. He can avoid all of that by winning and locking up his first Playoff qualification in franchise history. It's gotta feel good to control your own destiny like this.</p>
<p>On the FHLC Table, if Blake notches 3 Points and TPC gets 0 Points, Blake currently holds the points-scored tiebreaker between the two (and every other FHLC contender except for Matt & Ross). There are numerous scenarios in which Blake could raise the League Cup.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Kyle vs RTRO</h4>
<p>Kyle doesn't even need a win this week to secure a Playoff bye. He can lose as long as he scores TPC by 72 and they lose as well, and the bye is his. Or he can win and outscore TPC by 72 to guarantee a bye regardless of the TPC result.</p>
<p>DTTW has kept itself in the FHLC race. At 19 Points, its only 3 off the lead at 22 Points. A huge scoring week would move DTTW into a potential tie at the top of the Table where he'll have to hope that Matt & Ross and Blake aren't also in the mix. They'll likely win tiebreakers with their points-scored.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Mitch vs Gaudet & Cameron</h4>
<p>Mitch is into the Playoffs with a win. More than that, he's hoping for losses by Kyle and Scott & James, and hoping to outscore Scott & James by 64. That scenario would give Mitch the #2 seed and Playoff bye. A Mitch loss would potentially give us four 7-win teams vying for three Playoff spots.</p>
<p>Mitch is very similar to Kyle in points-scored, which means he's at a disadvantage when it comes to tie-breakers at the top of the Table. But unlike Kyle (19 Points), Mitch has a whopping 21 Points. 24 Points has a realistic shot at being the standalone winner of the League Cup. 3 Points should be at the top of the Mitch franchise's agenda this week.</p>
<p>ZJs have fought to remain in Playoff contention despite being the 3rd lowest scorer in the league. A ZJ win plus either a Blake OR Joseph & Mike loss puts ZJs into the Playoffs!</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Joseph & Mike vs Nick & Mickey</h4>
<p>This is by far the Rivalry of the Week</p>
<p>A Joseph & Mike victory puts them into the Playoffs as long as Gaudet & Cameron don't outscore them by 150. They're also only 2 Points off the top of the FHLC Table and well within striking distance in potential tiebreakers.</p>
<p>But mayhem ensues if Nick & Mickey can pull it off this week.</p>
<p>The complicating factor is that Nick & Mickey have more points-scored than 6-win TBH and ZJs, and are only 50 points away from catching Blake. If Nick & Mickey can beat Joseph & Mike, and Mitch can beat Gaudet & Cameron, Nick & Mickey could end up being as high as a #5 seed!</p>
<p>On the FHLC Table, if Blake notches 3 Points and TPC gets 0 Points, Blake currently holds the points-scored tiebreaker between the two (and every other FHLC contender except for Matt & Ross). There are numerous scenarios in which Blake could raise the League Cup.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Kfish vs Doug</h4>
<p>Kmish called this rivalry the Egg Bowl in his disappointment, but he actually isn't eliminated from Playoff qualification yet. Keeping Playoff hopes alive would take a historic 220 point week and hoping all other 5- and 6-win teams lose. There exists substantial downside as well, however. A Crockett win and bad Kmish loss could slide Kmish into the #11 seed of quicksand. It could go very well or very poorly.</p>
<p>Doug needs to win and have Crockett lose in order to escape the #11 seed quicksand of death.</p>

            <h5>Week 13</h5>
            <p>We're guaranteed to have a new Modern Era Playoff Champion this season now that Doug and RTRO have been eliminated. The amount of blue blood programs in the Consolation Ladder could be significant in that one of them will be starting with a -1 MWM Stage by losing the Sacko this season. Giving a franchise like Kmish, Crockett, or Doug a -1 start in the MWM Marathon would be huge for extending the Marathon.</p>

        <h5>Week 13</h5>
        <p>Scott & James and Joseph & Mike couldn't put it away, so here we are with 6 teams all within reach of the top of the Table.</p>
        <p>If TPC only posts 1 Point again this week, Matt & Ross and Mitch would jump into the top spot with 3 Points. 0 Points from TPC means that Matt & Ross and Mitch only need 1 Point to tie at the top and invoke tiebreakers.</p>
        <p>Joseph & Mike are slightly further off the lead. 1 Point won't do them any good, so they'll need a 3 Point result to have any shot.</p>
        <p>Blake and Kyle are each a full 3 Points off the current lead. They'll need lots of luck to get a 0 Point result from TPC and 1 or fewer Points from Matt & Ross, Mitch, and TBH.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p></p></li>
    <li><p>The Butlers lead the league in scoring this season at 132.8 PPG. A Diamond Season (140+ PPG) is probably off the table barring a postseason run for the ages.</p></li>
    <li><p>Matt & Ross have scored 347.1 points in their two meetings against Blake this season.</p></li>
    <li><p>And in doing so, set a franchise record win-streak. 6 wins in a row stands alone as the new high mark for the Butlers.</p></li>
    <li><p>Blake's Lamar Jackson 41.3 is the third best QB performance in franchise history ('18 Aaron Rodgers 55.4 and '16 Russell Wilson 42.1). It's the first time in Blake franchise history that he's gotten 25+ from the QB, RB1, and WR1 slots.</p></li>
    <li><p>The last time Blake scored 130+ and lost was in #RivalryWeek 2016. This week's 138.2 points in a loss is the second highest losing score in franchise history.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Crockett franchise enters week 13 with its lowest ever Playoff Standings rank (#10). In the previous four Modern Era seasons, the Kyle franchise was better than #10 entering week 13 only once. What a year to make that bet.</p></li>
    <li><p>Here's where the Doug franchise has been in the standings entering each week 13 of the Modern Era: 2015 - #2, 2016 - #11, 2017 - #1, 2018 - #2, 2019 - #11.</p></li>
    <li><p>This season has been an exercise in mean reversion for Doug. PPG through 12 weeks going back to 2014: 116.5, 119.3, 115.8, 141.3, 137.6, 115.6</p></li>
    <li><p>Joseph & Mike hold the all time record for lowest points scored in a win. It was a 76.0 - 64.0 victory over Gaudet & Cameron in 2017. It was the third lowest combined score on record.</p></li>
    <li><p>The second lowest points scored in a win was by Doug, in a 78.0 - 60.0 victory over Gaudet & Cameron in 2016. It was the second lowest combined score on record.</p></li>
    <li><p>The sixth lowest points scored in a win was by Gaudet & Cameron. 83.5 - 69.2 win over Doug in 2011.</p></li>
    <li><p>Gaudet & Cameron beat Joseph & Mike 84.6 - 65.2 this week, entering the record books as the seventh lowest score in a win.</p></li>
    <li><p>ZJs have now been involved in 4 of the 8 lowest scoring games.</p></li>
    <li><p>RTRO enters week 13 with their 2nd lowest scoring average in franchise history (111.6 PPG)</p></li>
    <li><p>Joseph & Mike have gotten their second 0.0 WR1 performance of the season. Brandin Cooks in week 8 and Amari Cooper this week.</p></li>
    <li><p>TBH went from facing 104.0 PPG last season to 125.3 PPG this season.</p></li>
    <li><p>Kmish enters week 13 at #9 in the Playoff Standings for the first time since 2011. The 5-7 record ties for second worst (2017 & 2013) behind the 3-9 record of 2011.</p></li>
    <li><p>DTTW had entered #RivalryWeek with 3 wins, 5 wins, 4 wins, and 4 wins during the Modern Era. This season the franchise boasts 8 wins, a Playoff Standing of #3, and among its best scoring performances (123.3 PPG second best of its ME).</p></li>
    <li><p>Here's a comment from the week 11 article: "Matt & Ross entered the season having seen both their RB1 and RB2 score 25+ in the same week two times ever. 2013 Shane Vereen & Jamaal Charles and 2017 Jordan Howard & Rod Smith. They've added two more dualing 25+ RB performances in 2019. Both were by CMC and Derrick Henry. Week 1 and last week."</p></li>
    <li><p>Yeah, well they've done it again. Make it three dualing 25+ CMC + Derrick Henry weeks in 2019. Good luck beating that two headed #Monster</p></li>
    <li><p>The Mitch franchise has now averaged 123+ PPG through twelve weeks in each of the last three seasons</p></li>
    <li><p>... and Mitch has still never had a losing record entering week 13. That's 9 seasons of 6-6 or better. Incredible</p></li>
    <li><p>In contrast, Nick & Mickey have now been 5-7 in 2018 and 2019. They skid into a 4-game losing streak, 1 shy of their franchise record which was set last season.</p></li>
    <li><p>With a 1.6 point lead over Crockett heading into MNF, Scott & James decided to prioritize a head-to-head win over a potential 3 League Cup Points. The Ravens scored 13 points which would indeed have given TPC a 3 Point result. Instead, they settle for 1 Point and hope to clinch both FHLC and a Playoff bye in #RivalryWeek. These types of decisions will be fun to watch in seasons to come.</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<p>We've already covered the #RivalryWeek matchups above. And with that, an article has been written for every week of the regular season. Thanks for the entertainment this year, and I trust that it'll get even better as we hit the postseason.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. Mitch's EuroThanksgiving spread looked delectable last week. Enjoy the Holidays with family if you're able to.</p>
