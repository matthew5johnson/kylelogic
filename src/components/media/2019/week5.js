                        <h1>Week 5</h1>
                        <h3>#RivalryWeek</h3>
<br></br>
<p>#RivalryWeek was established in 2014, and has recurred twice annually ever since. These rivalry match-ups have proven to be extremely rare. We got an opportunity to see our first ever post-season rivalry matchup last season when Blake played Scott & James for the 2018 Sacko in what doubled as a de-facto third #RivalryWeek showdown. They combined to put on quite a show by totaling the most combined points in Sacko history at 303.1. Blake prevailed 163-137 to cap off the first ever #RivalryWeek super sweep, going 3-0 in rivalry weeks for the season. Weâ€™ve still never seen a rivalry matchup in the playoffs.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Did last week feel like a low scoring week?  Well, the stats disagree. 116.77 PPG was the #30 lowest scoring week out of 68 in the Modern Era. 5 franchises scoring less than 100 points this week was also well behind the record (week 11 of 2015, when 8 (!!) franchises were below 100). Maybe it felt weird because of all the low-scoring WRs? 8 of the 12 WRs that were started as WR1s this week scored fewer than 9 fantasy points. That's the most of all-time (7 in week 5 of 2015).</p> 

<br></br>
<p>The Month of Scott & James sure did come crashing down in a hurry. We were preparing the locker room for a post-September champagne celebration, and then TPC goes and does this. As a matter of fact, it's their first -$10 low-score week in franchise history. NOOB fever was fun while it lasted.</p>

<br></br>
<p>From last week's article: "If Kyle beats Doug, we'll get to read about the last time Doug lost consecutive games in next week's article." Kyle upheld his end of the deal, so let's do this.</p>
<p>Since the start of 2017, the Doug franchise hadn't lost in consecutive weeks until now. It achieved a long-win-streak of 9 games in 2017 and 8 games in 2018.</p>
<p>The last time Doug experienced back-to-back losses was in his 2016 Sacko run. He finished the season by losing in weeks 15 and 16, and had entered the consolation bracket on a 4-game losing streak.</p>
<p>On the other side of this story, the Kyle franchise enters #RivalryWeek above .500 for the first time in franchise history despite scoring 98.6 points last week. It's very very rare to notch a win when scoring less than 100 points in a week ... it's occurred in 2.7% of games in league history, and requires the most exquisite of luck. The Crockett franchise actually leads the league in sub-100 point victories with 7 in its history. Matt & Ross and Joseph & Mike are close behind with 6 and 5 sub-100 wins, respectively.</p>
<p>But for DTTW, a win's a win no matter how it comes. And it was nice to pick up 1 League Cup Point while only scoring 98.6 points ... the lowest score to be awarded a League Cup Point.</p>
<p>Snatch a rivalry win this week and all of the sudden we'd be looking at a 4-1 DTTW potentially sitting atop the Playoff Standings.</p>

            <h5>Week 5</h5>
            <p>Mitch is back atop the Playoff Standings, but only by 26 points over TBH. Seeing Kyle and Scott & James in the top-4 is always fun.</p>
            <p>There are some real powerhouses at 2-2. Nick & Mickey are now +$30 on weekly high/low splits (5 highs, 2 lows), and are solidly 2nd in scoring this season. Matt & Ross, Kmish, and Doug all lurk in this range as playoff contenders.</p>
            <p>We've started every season of the Modern Era with at least one 0-4 team. 2019 has broken that trend, which means that this group of 1-3 squads is still entirely in the playoff picture.</p>

        <h5>Week 5</h5>
        <p>Unlike in the Playoff Standings, we've started to get some extreme stratification in the League Cup Table. TBH is off to a roaring start, and it's only right that Joseph & Mike sit atop the FHLC Table ... their own competition.</p>
        <p>Nick & Mickey and Mitch are still neck and neck at the top of the Table, and Scott & James are within shouting distance, but the teams below that will need to land League Cup Points this week to keep pace.</p> 
        <p>The Crockett franchise had a great shot at 1 League Cup Point this week, but decided to put its fate in the hands of Andy Dalton in a primetime game. And Crockett didn't hold back, either ... starting John Ross and Tyler Boyd along with Dalton might be the most uninformed move of the season. The epic failures of primetime Dalton couldn't be more well documented.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>The Mitch franchise finds itself at #1 for the fifth week in franchise history, and the first time since week 1 of 2015.</p></li>
    <li><p>Gaudet & Cameron's 1 League Cup Point this week came on the 3rd lowest score of 1 Point results (103.3)</p></li>
    <li><p>Chubb's 40.6 points were the second best from a RB in Nick & Mickey franchise history. (David Johnson 46.1 in week 15 of 2015)</p></li>
    <li><p>Remember when we talked about TBH either starting the season poorly or really great? It looks like we're getting the great version in 2019. Joseph & Mike are off to a brilliant 135.3 PPG and 10 League Cup Point start.</p></li>
    <li><p>For 8 full seasons ranging from 2011 to 2018, RTRO had zero weeks in last place. It has been 12th in the standings for two weeks in 2019. Worst start in franchise history.</p></li>
    <li><p>Tom Brady scored 2.2 fantasy points this week. That's the worst regular season QB performance by Scott & James, nudging their super longstanding Matt Hasselbeck 3.0 points in week 7 of 2011 out of TPC record books.</p></li>
    <li><p>Fun fact: There have been 5 negative-point QB performances in league history. Matt & Ross and Crockett each had two of those.</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 5 Rivalry Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Crockett vs Matt & Ross:</h5> Crockett leads this series 6-4, although Matt & Ross swept both #RivalryWeeks last season to end their 5-game losing streak. With that said, their week 13 win last season came because Crockett decided to intentionally lose the game in favor of picking a specific playoff matchup. It obviously failed spectaculary. For three years we've had the Butlers in the Consolation Bracket while Crockett has been in the Playoffs.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Doug vs Kmish:</h5> Doug leads this series 6-4 and for a second year in a row enters #RivalryWeek defending his Playoff Championship. Kmish has a longer active Playoff qualification streak, however, finishing in the top-6 for three consecutive seasons.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>RTRO vs Kyle:</h5> RTRO leads this series 8-2. DTTW enters #RivalryWeek with its best record in franchise history, and hopes to make this series competitive for the first time. As has been the case a few times throughout history, the Kyle franchise is on the cusp of taking that next step and only needs to win #RivalryWeek to get there.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Blake vs Scott & James:</h5> Blake leads this series 5-2 and comes off our first rivalry super sweep last season (3-0). The average score between these two franchises has been a surprising 133.0 - 116.9 in favor of Blake. This suggests that unlike in a few of the other matchups this week, the winner of this game will have to outscore their relatively high-scoring opponent. Coming off of a clash in the Sacko, this is a good pick for our #Rivalry most on the rise right now.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Joseph & Mike vs Nick & Mickey:</h5> Joseph & Mike lead this series 5-3. TBH was on a tear, winning #RivalryWeek one and two in 2016, #RivalryWeek one and two in 2017, and the first #RivalryWeek of 2018. Nick & Mickey were able to temporarily stop the bleeding with a resounding 187 â€“ 102 win in #RivalryWeek two of last season, but theyâ€™ll need to continue that success to get back into this overall series. This rivalry just keeps churning out contenders unlike nearly any other rivalry. The #4 franchise in 2015 (Nick & Mickey), #3 in 2016 (Joseph & Mike), #3 in 2017 (Nick & Mickey), and #2 in 2018 (Joseph & Mike) all came out of this rivalry. That means weâ€™re getting one of these two franchises in the Playoff Semi-Finals during every season of the young history of these expansion franchises. It might still be a relatively new rivalry, but its status is skyrocketing with all of the combined success itâ€™s generating.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Mitch vs Gaudet & Cameron:</h5> Mitch leads this series 6-4. This our third oldest rivalry and has produced the most combined Playoff Championships (4). The Mitch franchise comes into this week on top of the Standings yet again, and the ZJs haven't been able to put up much resistance so far this season. This season has all the makings of a ZJ recipe for disaster, and we could very well see Mitch blow this series open starting in a few days.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Let's end with this. The Crockett franchise traded for Wayne Gallman this past weekend. Gallman got off to a great start in his first few minutes on Sunday:</p>
<img class="article" src="http://thecrewffl.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/9/0/51900477/crockettplayoffs_orig.png"></img>
<br></br>
<p>Gallman ended up being the leading Gray scorer, and it was looking like he had done just enough to upset Mitch going into Monday Night Football.</p>
<br></br>
<img class="article" src="http://thecrewffl.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/9/0/51900477/gallman_orig.png"></img>
<br></br>
<p>Alas, it turned out yet again to be unwise to pin hopes and dreams on Andy Dalton in primetime.</p>
<br></br>
<img class="article" src="http://thecrewffl.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/9/0/51900477/finalscore_orig.png"></img>
<br></br>
<p>A loss to the Butlers this week would put Crockett at 1-4. There have been 14 instances of teams starting 1-4 throughout history. Three of those went on to be Sacko, and only one of those fourteen eventually qualified for the Playoffs. This is a pivotal week.</p>
