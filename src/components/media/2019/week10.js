                        <h1>Week 10</h1>
                        <h3>Playoff Bye Tossup</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>This is the time of the year when the pressure starts to mount not only for Playoff hopefuls, but also for those in contention of a coveted Playoff Bye. TPC could have taken another step closer to a Bye with a win last week, but instead ended up with the overall weekly low-score. Joseph & Mike failed to take advantage of TPC's trip up as they lost to Matt & Ross.</p>
<p>We now have a well defined tier of Playoff Bye contenders that consists of Scott & James, Joseph & Mike, Matt & Ross, and Nick & Mickey. All four have around 1,200 points scored, and the group is only separated by two games.</p>
<p>Just behind that top tier is Blake, who is having a season to remember, Mitch, and Kyle. Amazingly, Kfish, Gaudet & Cameron, and Crockett are nipping at the heels of currently top-6 franchises. That means we have ourselves a good old fashioned ten team playoff race with four weeks to play.</p>
<p>It's likely that at least one 7-win franchise will be left out of the Playoffs this season for the first time in four seasons. As good as the season has gone for TPC so far, this means a TPC Consolation Bracket appearance is still within the realm of possibilites.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Last week's league-wide scoring average of 125.2 PPG falls directly in the middle of scoring weeks this season.</p>

<br></br>
<p>In the hypothetical retrospective MWM Stage Final last week, Matt & Ross would have defeated Mitch by a score of 143 to 117. We'd now be faced with the suddenly very real threat of The Butlers going back-to-back and winning our first Maze's Width Marathon.</p>

<br></br>
<h3>Major Competitions</h3>
<p>The best way of visualizing the four competitions is by visiting the <a href="/competitions">competitions</a> page on a non-mobile device. We have a Playoff Championship <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i>, Marathon <i id="icons" class="fas fa-award"></i>, League Cup <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i>, and a Community Shield <i id="icons" class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>.</p>

            <h5>Week 10</h5>
            <p>It's anybody's guess as to who will end up securing the two Playoff Byes, and who will qualify for the other four Playoff spots. But one thing is for sure .. it's shaping up to be an insane RivalryWeek in week 13.</p>
            <p>If the Standings remain similar to today, the following rivalries could have major playoff implications when week 13 arrives: TPC v Blake could just as easily be a Playoff Bye playin game as it could be an outright Playoff elimination game; Nick & Mickey v Joseph & Mike will almost certainly determine one of the Playoff Bye awards; Matt & Ross v Crockett might ultimately determine the Crockett's '19 fate; Mitch v ZJs is almost always a Playoff relevant rivalry, so nothing changes this season; Kyle will probably be in a position he's been in once before - needing to beat RTRO to make it into the Playoffs.</p>
            <p>The Doug v Kmish rivalry looks like it's close to going all the way off the rails this season, but stranger things have happened. It'll take a fortuitous set of circumstances, but Kmish could easily work himself well into the thick of the playoff hunt, and so could Doug.</p>
            <p>Total points will soon become a focal issue since they serve as the Playoff qualifcation tiebreaker among equivalent records.</p>

        <h5>Week 10</h5>
        <p>It was mostly a story of lost opportunity last week, as the rest of the contenders were unable to capitalize on TPC's weak 0 Point showing.</p>
        <p>Of the four franchises which secured 3 Points, three are irrelevant in the FHLC Table (Doug, Blake, and Crockett). However one franchise, Matt & Ross, was able to step out of tier two and enter the fray of true League Cup contenders with their 3 Point result.</p>
        <p>Joseph & Mike did salvage a Point, however, they remain 2 Points behind TPC at the top of the Table.</p>
        <p>Matt & Ross, Mitch, and -maybe- Nick & Mickey all might be juuuuust close enough to give the Cup a shot over the final four weeks of the season. 24 Points probably won't be enough to win the League Cup, so you have to figure that the 12-pointers Doug and Blake are all but eliminated now.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>Scott & James' Pats D/ST is human afterall, scoring a mere 1 point last week. It's the first time in four weeks that TPC has gotten less than 20 points from their defense, and the first time all season their Pats DST has scored less than 14 points.</p></li>
    <li><p>Without the elite defensive performance, TPC suffers as the weekly low-scorer. Their 15th weekly low-score in franchise history.</p></li>
    <li><p></p></li>
    <li><p>The Blake v Scott & James rivalry never fails to disappoint, as Blake continues the trend of handing Ls to TPC. Blake's weekly high-score means he harvests the weekly prize from TPC. It's the Blake franchise's second weekly high-score in three weeks, and fifth in franchise history.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Doug franchise has broken its six-game losing streak by beating Nick & Mickey in a high scoring affair.</p></li>
    <li><p>In a bid for the history books, RTRO refused to break its six-game losing streak last week. Now at seven games, its a single loss away from tying the all-time losing streak record of 8 in a row (2011 Gaudet & Cameron, 2015 Garner & Doyle, 2016 Gaudet & Cameron).</p></li>
    <li><p>ZJ's 113 PPG is their best through 9 weeks since scoring 114 PPG in 2016. Those are the only two 110+ PPG seasons they've had during the Modern Era.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Crockett franchise's 108.7 PPG is the lowest 9-week average in franchise history. It was also below 110 PPG in 2017 (109.6 PPG)</p></li>
    <li><p>As great as Joseph & Mike's first 9 games were last season (131.2 PPG), they've been better this season (134.8 PPG). They're in contenion, as usual. They've had a winning record entering week 10 in three of their five seasons.</p></li>
    <li><p>It's very unusual to see the Kmish franchise enter week 10 below 0.500 ... it's only happened twice in the last six years, including this year (4-5 record).</p></li>
    <li><p>DTTW gets a critical victory over Scott & James despite Adam Thielen, its WR1, posting 0 points. It's an event that turns out is less rare than I had anticipated, having happened seven times in the Modern Era. The two most recent occurrences: Nick & Mickey won the 2017 Third Place Game despite Michael Crabtree scoring 0.0, and Nick & Mickey won in week 1 of 2018 despite Doug Baldwin scoring 0.0</p></li>
    <li><p>Kyle is above 0.500 entering week 10 for the first time since 2016!</p></li>
    <li><p>CMC is the great eraser. Matt & Ross post 140+ points and notch the W even though they got a combined 18.2 from Diggs, Gallup, and Anderson. McCaffrey's 39 points covers up a lot.</p></li>
    <li><p>... and it just so happens that Matt & Ross' RB1 slot is averaging 29.4 PPG this season. That's more than 10 PPG clear of their previous franchise record of 17 RB1 PPG! It's also the best 9 week RB1 average in the history of our league, beating out Nick & Mickey's 29.0 RB1 PPG from last season. Next highest are 2018 Kyle's 25 RB1 PPG and 2014 RTRO's 23 RB1 PPG.</p></li>
    <li><p>Mitch's Cowboys DST 17.0 points is his second best defensive performance of the season (Steelers 19.0 points in week 4)</p></li>
    <li><p>Russell Wilson's 48.7 goes into Nick & Mickey's record books as the 2nd best QB performance, trailing only Russell's 51.3 point game in week 3 of this season. Nick & Mickey have now had four 40+ QB performances in franchise history (Russell Wilson 51.3 and 48.7, 2017 Big Ben 42.7, 2018 Philip Rivers 40.5)</p></li>
    <li><p>TPC has now lost to Kyle in three consecutive matchups.</p></li>   
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 10 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Matt & Ross (6-3) vs Kfish (4-5):</h3> Kmish is projected to win this game in a high scoring match. He'll need Kamara at full strength if he hopes to keep up with CMC. Matt & Ross are going to need more solid play from their WRs to make serious postseason noise, but the talent is surely there. The Butlers could use this week to begin Playoff Bye positioning, and a loss by Kmish would be a brutal blow to that franchise's playoff hopes.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Kyle (5-4) vs Mitch (5-4):</h3> Mitch is projected to win this game going away. DTTW was able to take advantage of a smash spot against TPC's bye-gutted squad last week, but the fantasy gods have not smiled on DTTW this week. Mitch's Mahomes appears to be back (against the Titans), David Johnson gets Tampa, Ingram gets Cincy, and Mike Evans will obliterate Arizona. An upset by Kyle this week would be large for his Playoff hopes.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Nick & Mickey (5-4) vs Crockett (4-5):</h3> Nick has promised the league a win this week. They scrambled to pick up a TE in free agency and still need to pick up a kicker, but this matchup will come down to a battle of position groups: Crockett's RBs bvs Nick & Mickey's WRs. Nick & Mickey need 3 League Cup Points here, and Crockett needs a head-to-head victory.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Blake (5-4) vs RTRO (1-8):</h3> These are the kinds of games an up and coming franchise like Blake has to take care of. Blake's Nuk and Fournette are both out on bye, and RTRO is largely at full strength. This has forced Blake to go with a heavy set of two TEs. However, Lamar Jackson, TyFreek Hill, and RoJo+DMont could be enough to overcome the temporary roster deficiencies.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Gaudet & Cameron (4-5) vs Scott & James (7-2):</h3> TPC has 6 potential starters on bye. ZJs have 3 starters on bye. This will be a test to see who can win this week's war of bye-week attrition. If James Conner starts and plays up to his ability, it could swing the matchup in favor of ZJs and catapult them into more serious Playoff talk next week.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Joseph & Mike (5-4) vs Doug (3-6):</h3> No Brandin Cooks? No problem for TBH. Joseph & Mike are riding upon the powerful quad of Matt Ryan + Dalvin Cook + Amari Cooper + Austin Hooper. Doug will need eye popping performances from Dak, Zeke, and Kittle to keep this matchup close. A win for TBH keep them in Playoff Bye contention. 3 Points would put them alone at the top of the League Cup Table if TPC were to stumble again. Doug needs to win the next 4 games to have any chance of squeaking into the Playoffs. </p>
