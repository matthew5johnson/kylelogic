                        <h1>Week 1 is Upon Us</h1>
<p>Packers Bears will kick off the fantasy season tomorrow night. Then we’ve got back-to-back mega games on Saturday, with aTm going to Clemson and LSU going to Austin. We cap the weekend off with a full slate of NFL games on Sunday, followed by a Monday Night Football double header including the Texans in the Dome. It’s all here.
</p>
<br></br>
<p>Today we’re going to recap the draft, do some playoff odds, and conclude by peering into the Palantir so as to predict the outcomes of 2019. 
</p>
<br></br>
<h3>Draft Recap</h3>
<br></br>
<p>Our first destination draft took place in 2016. It was a beach draft at Gulf Shores. The destination draft trend has since flourished, as we traveled to North Carolina in 2017, Las Vegas in 2018, and did another beach draft this past weekend. The eight-person live attendance represented 7 of the 12 franchises in the league. It was a blast.
</p>
<p>Sorry to everyone trying to join the livestream. I guess our internet couldn’t handle 7 drafting laptops with concurrent video feed. But I have to say that the draft google spreadsheet that Doug came up with last year was amazing yet again.
</p>
<p>
Thank you, Doug for handling the logistics of the trip. Thank you, Kmish for running yet another flawlessly smooth draft. Enforcing time limits on Crockett is no small task. This draft is the quickest draft that we’ve ever done, with #1 Saquon Barkley picked at 12:02pm and #192 Brett Maher picked at 2:37pm for a duration of exactly 2 hours and 35 minutes.
</p>
<p>
The league champion gets to decide draft location – James has already pushed for the 2020 draft to be at his parents’ North Carolina mountain house, so we can expect an east coast trip next Fall if The People’s Choice comes out with the title this season. Blake suggested a Chicago draft at his new place if he wins this year. Gaudet has offered his family's beach house as well. Three great options already on the table, so future 2019 league champion, keep these in mind.    
</p>
<p>
We still had a solid 3 hours of beach time after the draft concluded. Much throwing of the football was enjoyed, and there was a concert with two (apparently) big name country singers 200 yards down the beach. James returned with a gnarly jellyfish sting.
</p>
<p>
It was back to the room just in time for kickoff of Oklahoma vs Houston, and I think half the room must have had action on the under. Spoiler alert … the over hit for no reason at all, with subs in the game, zero Houston timeouts, and victory formation as the clear and correct call, when the backup OU running back broke tackles to score a 20 yard TD with basically no time remaining. Kfish was in the fetal position on the floor, and I don’t blame him. Thought we had it.
</p>
<p>
We started playing Secret Hitler (card game) just before kickoff of the game, and didn’t stop playing until after 1am. Doug was Hitler in game 1, easily winning since most everyone at the table was playing for the first time. The game mechanics were exploited a bit in a later game when the 3 fascists were all on the same side of the table, and president made it to the other side of the table where it stayed for a while, leaving the fascists with no choice but to watch liberal policies pass every round. Then Kmish won as Hitler in as well played of a round as we had all night. Kyle’s volatility and total randomness made for great fun, seeing as how nobody could ever determine whose team he was actually on. In one of the games he was a liberal, yet decided to help push through multiple fascist policies and inexplicably lose the game for his liberal party. As a liberal, Crockett killed two fellow liberals in one game early in the night. In the penultimate game, Scott would reveal MJ as a fascist within 2 turns, and it became a game-long battle between the two for supremacy. The fascists shockingly went on to win that round.
</p>
<p>And now we return to fantasy >>> </p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Playoff Odds</h3>
<br></br>
<h4>Tier 1</h4>
<h5>Matt & Ross: 68%</h5>
<h5>Nick & Mickey: 66%</h5>
<h5>Kfish: 62%</h5>
<p>
Matt & Ross and Nick & Mickey were clear winners of the draft. They each locked up immense talents with their first two picks, starting CMC & Antonio Brown and Davante Adams & Nick Chubb, respectively. Starting with RB and WR gave them the freedom to really load up on value throughout the middle rounds, and upside players in the later rounds. They did it in polar opposite ways, though. Matt & Ross went 3 WRs followed by 3 RBs in rounds 2 through 7, while Nick & Mickey went 3 RBs followed by 3 WRs in those rounds. Both outcomes are superb on paper. Interestingly, neither of these franchises made a draft pick trade, something that all but one champion has ever opted to do.
</p>
<p>
Kmish, on the other hand, traded aggressively to load up on FAAB while also targeting his guys. His pre-draft swap of 3’s, 4’s, and 8’s with Kyle let him get Chris Carson, Robert Woods, and Lesean McCoy with those picks, including an extra 75 FAAB when accounting for the combined Kyle and RTRO trades. That sequence of trades could be looked back on as a vital piece of what ends up being a championship contending roster.
</p>
<p>
Surely Matt & Ross will find their form again with this roster in 2019. Nick & Mickey continue to dominate the league, so this is nothing new for them. And Kmish has been sneakily consistent every year, so being in the top tier yet again is nothing new for that franchise either. These are three of the top franchises in our league, and look to be behemoths again this season. 
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>Tier 2</h4>
<h5>RTRO: 52%</h5>
<h5>Kyle: 51%</h5>
<h5>Joseph & Mike: 51%</h5>
<p>
Could this be the first time the Kyle franchise is truly in a playoff hunt from the very beginning of a season? The Kyle franchise has only once had a winning record heading into Rivalry Week 5 (3-1 in 2013), and it seems like an early fast start is important if a playoff push is to be in the cards this season. Adam Theilen and Jarvis Landry will probably have to put DTTW on their back if that’s to be the case. 
</p>
<p>
On the other end of the spectrum, the Joseph & Mike franchise is coming off of a #2 finish in 2018, and has exploded out to 4-0 starts in two of the past three seasons. They even decided to dip a toe into the trade waters this year which is exciting. TBH is coming around, and will be a menace to deal with if Gurley’s knees hold up and Amari’s plantar fasciitis subsides soon. Their rivalry dominance over the Nick & Mickey franchise is something to behold, going 5-1 since 2015, an edge that will likely need to be a driving force in 2019 if they hope to contend once again.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>Tier 3</h4>
<h5>Mitch: 46%</h5>
<h5>Doug: 45%</h5>
<h5>Blake: 45%</h5>
<p>
Now that Zeke has signed, the Doug franchise might try to make a case for vaulting into the second tier. However, potential roadblocks to a title defense include drafting Damien Williams without being aware of the LeSean McCoy news, and reaching for a couple of his mid-round targets (Guice in the 5th & Larry Fitzgerald in the 6th). But the Doug franchise clearly had a plan coming into the draft and stuck to it. Doug’s recent success has earned him the benefit of the doubt for the time being.
</p>
<p>
The Mitch franchise might be lacking just a bit of upside from its bench, but there’s nothing to suggest it won’t be competing for a fourth straight playoff qualification and third straight top-3 finish. A large portion of the Mitch franchise’s success this season will rest on the effectiveness of the Arizona offense and how well it can support David Johnson. Last year the Mitch franchise took advantage of some shrewd free agency moves, laying the groundwork for a plan that might be used again this year. 
</p>
<p>
Drafting one spot ahead of Mitch was Blake, who must have been shocked to see Tyreke Hill fall all the way to him in the second round. If you squint and look at it hard enough, this roster can take the shape of a league winner if a few pieces fall in just the right way. Fournette leading the league in rushing, David Montgomery winning rookie of the year, and Baker being league MVP are all within the range of possible outcomes. It’s a roster that might very well produce the Blake franchise’s first taste of the playoffs.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>Tier 4</h4>
<h5>Gaudet & Cameron: 41%</h5>
<h5>Crockett: 37%</h5>
<h5>Scott & James: 36%</h5>
<p>
The ZJs came into the draft with a very well-defined strategy which was executed to perfection. They undoubtedly chose to swing for the fences with the strategy, which does hinder their chances of making the playoffs, but in the off-chance it ends up working, vaults them into being among the favorites to win the league overall. Going with Kelce in the second round meant they would have to load up on position players in the middle rounds, and they chose the Patriots stack of Edelman and James White. AJ Green is a mega risk/reward play in the fifth. That was followed by some wild home run swings on young upside receivers with the next three picks. They concluded the firework show with a grand finale of Kyler Murray in the 9th, and sought safety with Big Ben in the following round. I love the conviction it took to buck the traditional style of drafting, and I love what this roster could end up doing this year if AJ Green returns to 100% and Kyler’s air raid offense ends up taking the NFL by storm. 
</p>
<p>
After talking about so much upside, it’s tough to even look at the Crockett franchise’s roster. Saquon is obviously the staple, but Crockett’s entire season will rest on the health of Devonta Freeman and the emotional stability/rationality of Melvin Gordon and his agent. The decision to start RB RB RB means that there are no stud WRs to rely on weekly, and that this franchise is now banking on finding two mid round pass catchers who end up popping. To top it off, waiting on TE resulted in not having a reliable player to fill the starting TE slot. It all adds up to a bunch of question marks, a bottomless pit of potential downside, and crazy high amounts of risk all for only a modicum of upside. I can report that based on his reactions on draft day, Crockett was none too happy with how his draft turned out.
</p>
<p>
Bringing up the rear, as it did as Sacko last year, is the Scott & James franchise. The decision to go with a “zero-RB” draft strategy was fine, but it requires hitting on a few later round RBs. After starting WR WR TE WR, it’s tough to imagine feeling comfortable looking at a RB corps of Lindsay, Cohen, Murray, Penny, Ballage, Hunt, and Adrian Peterson. A positive takeaway from this draft is that the Ertz + Alshon stack gives them exposure to one of the top offenses in the league. Can Lamar Jackson be this year’s version of Patty Mahomes, and carry The People’s Choice back into playoff contention?
</p>

<br></br>
<h3>Peering into the Palantir</h3>
<br></br>
<h4>Championship Game</h4>
<h5>Nick & Mickey vs Kfish</h5>
<p>
As we saw above, these are both tier 1 rated rosters post-draft, and both have a reasonable strength of schedule. The Nick & Mickey franchise has quietly been putting up consistently solid numbers and banging on the door of the elite tier for multiple seasons now. They’re averaging the fourth highest points per game (123.5) and have posted two top-4 league finishes. A nearly identical description applies to the Kmish franchise, which has averaged the fifth highest PPG (120.2) and has also posted two top-4 league finishes. It’s crazy that Kmish has yet to even participate in a league title game during his 9 years of recorded history. That changes this season. Nick & Mickey take the 2019 title in dramatic fashion to formally announce their arrival into the elite tier of franchises. Remember that both franchises in this game qualify for next season’s Maze’s Width Marathon 2020 Stage.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>3rd Place Game</h4>
<h5>Blake vs Joseph & Mike</h5>
<p>
These probably aren’t the first two franchises that you think of if basing predictions off of past stats, but they both buck the trend this season. Both are riding momentum from last season, albeit on different ends of the spectrum – Joe & Mike must have last season’s championship game appearance still in the short-term memory banks, and will surely look to build on what was an epic 10-win regular season that led to a playoff bye. Blake, on the other hand, compiled a slew of bad breaks starting in the first half of the first game of the season when Aaron Rodgers suffered what appeared to be a serious injury. Rodgers would return to the game and perform well for the season, but other injuries quickly stacked up for the Blake franchise including Jay Ajayi and Marquise Goodwin. Despite all of this, he was able to crush his RIVAL in our first ever rivalry Sacko showdown. The Blake franchise gets its first taste of playoff fantasy in 2019 and qualifies for MWM ’20 Stage by virtue of winning the 3rd Place Game. 
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>5th Place Game</h4>
<h5>Doug vs Scott & James</h5>
<p>
Two of the last three Sackos have bounced back to make the playoffs in the following year. This is good news for Scott & James. TPC is performing very well during the Modern Era though. They’re only three years removed from a championship game appearance and have another top 5 finish tossed in there as well. The Doug franchise has been the biggest heavy weight of the Modern Era, stacking consecutive League Titles and championship game appearances in 3 of the past 4 years. A 5th place finish might seem like a down season for Doug, but it qualifies him for a coveted spot in next year’s MWM Stage. While it doesn’t wipe away their freshly acquired Sacko, Scott & James shouldn’t be disappointed with their third top-5 finish in 5 seasons.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>Consolation Ladder Championship</h4>
<h5>Kyle vs Mitch</h5>
<p>
The Kyle franchise has been the king of the consolation bracket. Since 2010, it has been in the consolation bracket every single season, yet has never suffered the fate of being a Sacko. He’s even got one consolation ladder championship already (2012). Mitch has a great 2019 season, but misses out on the playoffs by one game in a gut-wrenching loss to Gaudet & Cameron in #RivalryWeek13. In it’s biggest win in franchise history, Kyle wins the consolation ladder and qualifies for next season’s MWM Stage. The Kyle franchise will then opt to turn its attention solely to the Marathon since it’s had such well-documented struggles with making the playoffs. Turning its focus to MWM might actually end up being a prudent move for the Kyle franchise.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>Sacko Game</h4>
<h5>Crockett vs Gaudet & Cameron</h5>
<p>
Bet you weren’t expecting to see these traditional powerhouses in the Sacko, huh? After 13 straight weeks of furiously trying to rectify its draft mistakes by setting a new record for roster moves (current record = 63 by RTRO in ’16), the draft holes are too much to overcome for the Crockett franchise. The Crockett franchise finds itself in its first ever Sacko, extinguishes its record tying four-season playoff run, and notches its worst finish in franchise history (Crockett’s worst finish = #7 in ’12).
</p>
<p>
For the ZJs, a few of their bold draft moves unfortunately fail to pan out which leaves them plummeting to the bottom of the league. This is starting to become frighteningly familiar territory for them with their #10 (’16), #12 (‘17 Sacko), and #9 (’18) finishes over the past three seasons. The Crockett franchise edges out the Gaudet & Cameron franchise in the Sacko this season, narrowly avoiding a catastrophic -1 MWM Stage result, and living to fight another day in 2020. The ZJs must now win three Maze’s Width Marathon Stages in order to win the Marathon.
</p>

<br></br>
<h4>MWW 2020 Stage Qualifiers:</h4>
<p>
According to these predictions, Nick & Mickey and Kmish both will have won their semifinal contests in week 15. That gives them the 1 and 2 seeds in next years MWM Stage. Blake will have won the 3rd place game, qualifying as the 3 seed in next year’s Stage. Those top three seeds all get first-round byes in the 2020 Stage. Doug will have won the 5th place game which matches him up with Kyle, who has qualified by virtue of winning the Consolation Bracket. After losing the Sacko, Gaudet & Cameron will now need to win 3 MWM Stages in order to win the Marathon instead of 2.
</p>

<h3>What I'm most looking forward to this season</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
Will we get another classic Kmish Report, even if it's only Kmish's classic draft rankings? Another Crewcast episode? How about another “Doug and the Kmish” podcast episode? An annual installment of the HaterZone column? Even something new, maybe? There’s nothing better than seeing a notification for a newly posted article or podcast.

</p></li>
<li><p>
Seeing who wins the league title, and thus finding out where we’ll be drafting next year
</p></li>
</ul>


<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Thanks to everyone who both attended the draft and who made the draft experience possible. That's an event I look forward to every year, and I loved seeing everyone. Sorry to those of you who couldn't make it - let's try to plan on getting even more people there next year.</p>
<p>Clemson is still -17.5 while LSU has jumped all the way to -6 now. Everyone who's going to Austin, fly/drive safely and let's get a dub. Packers Bears tomorrow night is very fantasy relevant, so that's going to be a fun way to kick off the season. And best of luck to the Saints this season.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Gentlemen. Let the games begin.</p>
