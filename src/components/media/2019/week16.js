                        <h3>Championship Week</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>The Blake and Kyle franchises were the only two to have never made the Playoffs before. With both of them qualifying this season, now all twelve franchises in the league have been to the Playoffs at least once during the Modern Era.</p>
<p>The first two tickets into MWM 2020 are printed with Playoff Semifinal wins. Blake and Kyle each took care of business last week in their Semifinal games and have qualified as the #1 and #2 seeds in MWM 2020, earning a first round bye in that competition.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Playoffs</h3>
<br></br>

<h4>Playoff Championship: Kyle vs Blake</h4>
<p>What a whirlwind of a season it's been for these two franchises. Kyle going from never having made the Playoffs to earning a Playoff bye, disposing of ZJs in the Semifinals, and ending up playing for it all in week 16. Kyle is averaging 121.8 PPG this season, the best of its Modern Era (107.1 in 2015, 116.6 in 2016, 106.1 in 2017, and 111.4 in 2018). DTTW's best finish was at #6 in 2012, and it hadn't placed in the single digits during the entire Modern Era (#10, #10, #11, #11). This is a turnaround for the ages. Note that a Kyle Playoff Championship would likely vault the RTRO v DTTW rivalry to the top of all rivalries ... that rivalry alone would then account for 60% of Modern Era Playoff Championships.</p>
<p>Blake was an expansion franchise added in 2016. It began slowly as the franchise was wisely reticent to make any brash moves while it quietly learned the ropes. That led to a slow start consisting of #8, #8, and #11 finishes. But the decisive trade for Lamar Jackson earlier this season represented the Blake franchise officially coming into its own. Blake is 9-4 since trading for Lamar, and Lamar has posted the following scores in games since his bye week: 34, 39, 37, 41, 26, 23, 40. The Blake franchise had to win an epic 108-105 Tellarico Brother Showdown to advance out of Round 1, and then crushed the three-time Playoff Champion Matt & Ross 141-122 last week to advance to this week 16 Holy Grail. Blake is averaging 128.4 PPG in 2019, by far the most in franchise history (112.8 in 2016, 109.9 in 2017, 106.1 in 2018).</p>
<p>The winner of this Playoff Championship will be crowned as the Playoff Champion, secure the #1 seed in MWM 2020, and gain qualification to the 2020 Community Shield game against Matt & Ross (FHLC Winner) in week 3 of next season.</p>
<p>The loser will secure the #2 seed in MWM 2020.</p>
<p>Blake won their only meeting this season by a score of 131.9 - 91.8, and is projected to win this game 138.3 - 126.3. Kyle has only outscored Blake in 4 of 15 weeks throughout the season.</p>
<p>Lamar gets a favorable matchup against the Browns, Fournette is in the Georgia Dome, and Nuk is @ Tampa. The only tough matchup for The Marmalade Servers this week is probably Tyfreek Hill at Chicago. As for DTTW, Drew Brees is outdoors in Nashville, Mixon is at Miami, Drake is at Seattle, Thielen is being thrown to by Cousins in primetime (not good...), and Jarvis is going up against the stellar Baltimore defense. Blake's entire roster will be finished playing for the season at the end of the Sunday Night game, and Kyle has three players going on Monday Night. This should all come down to the Packers Vikings MNF showdown.</p>
<p>What a season it's been for these two franchises. Huge congratulations to you both.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>3rd Place Game: Matt & Ross vs Gaudet & Cameron</h4>
<p>These two storied franchises have combined for six Playoff Championships. Wow.</p>
<p>While neither will be adding to that tally in 2019, there is a coveted MWM 2020 bid on the line here. The winner will land a first round bye in MWM 2020 while the loser gets nothing.</p>
<p>Matt & Ross led the league in scoring this season (132.0 PPG) and won the inaugural Finch Howe League Cup in dramatic fashion. The Butlers FHLC has already qualified them for the 2020 Community Shield which will take place in 2020 week 3 against the winner of the Blake v Kyle matchup this week. A League Cup, Community Shield qualification, and MWM qualification couldn't be seen as anything other than a successful season for Matt & Ross, so there's a lot on the line this week.</p>
<p>The ZJs only scored 115.5 PPG this season, yet still ended up making it this far. They hadn't been to the Playoffs since 2015 and were Sackos as recently as 2017, so it was nice to see them make some noise again. A win to qualify for MWM 2020, their namesake, would keep this franchise pointed in the right direction.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>5th Place Game: Mitch vs Scott & James</h4>
<p>Unlike ever before, this 5th Place Game means a whole lot. The winner will qualify for MWM 2020 while the loser will get nothing and finish #6 in 2019.</p>
<p>Scott & James had a stellar season. They've scored 127.1 PPG marking only their second time scoring 120+ during the Modern Era (131.6 PPG in 2016). TPC was #1 in the Playoff Standings for 7 of 13 weeks in 2019, and was in position for a Playoff Bye from week 6 onward until collapsing in the final week of the regular season. In a year deemed "The Year of TPC" it's a bitter pill to swallow to merely be playing in the 5th Place Game - the consolation game of the Playoff bracket - and for this reason it seems like ALL of the pressure is on TPC. They've had a great season only to see it nearly slip away leaving them with absolutely nothing. They need to win this game to earn a MWM 2020 bid and have something to show for what was arguably their best season in franchise history.</p>
<p>The Mitch franchise has now tied the record for most consecutive Playoff appearances with four. The sheer consistency of this battle tested franchise (2011 Playoff Champion) seems like an annual MWM threat, and a win here would jump start its prospects of chasing down the Marathon. Big things on the horizon for Mitch with a victory over TPC this weekend.</p>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<h3>Consolation Ladder</h3>
<br></br>

<h4>Consolation Ladder Championship: Crockett vs Doug</h4>
<p>The Consolation Ladder Championship has gone from being meaningless in years past to now carrying with it a bid to the 2020 MWM Stage. You won't be earning a bye in that competition like the top seeds will, but after having a rough season and missing the playoffs, a MWM qualification here is like a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Win this game and you'll be in the MWM dance come week 7 of next season. Win and the season is a success.</p>
<p>The Crockett franchise has snapped its tied-for-longest Playoff qualification streak of 4, and the Doug franchise is one week away from no longer defending its back-to-back Playoff Championships. Despite these two disappointments, these two clubs have to be relieved to avoid the perils of a Sacko in 2019 and ecstatic to have an opportunity to qualify for MWM.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>9th Place Game: Joseph & Mike vs RTRO</h4>
<p>Joseph & Mike scored ~120 PPG and logged 6 regular season wins. TBH stood at the top of the League Cup Table for at least a week, found themselves within the top-3 of the Playoff Standings for 8 of 13 weeks, and were only outside of the top-6 ... for ONE week (week 13). In other words, make the Playoffs at any other point during the season and TBH is there. It's an unfortunate collapse down the stretch. Joseph & Mike can be grateful that they avoid the 2019 Sacko.</p>
<p>RTRO scored ~109 PPG and logged 3 regular season wins. It's been a forgettable year after setting the all-time scoring record in 2018. RTRO is happy to avoid the Sacko game and is thankful to live to play another day. (no Sacko MWM deletion to worry about!)</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Sacko Game: Kmish vs Nick & Mickey</h4>
<p>This game is now monumentally important. A loss here gives you -1 MWM Stage which means that you'll have to win THREE MWM Stages to win the Marathon (instead of two Stages to win MWM). In addition, the loser is saddled with the #12 draft pick selection. Being Sacko is noooooot the way to go anymore.</p>
<p>Nick & Mickey's worst ever finish was #8 last season. They've made the Playoffs in 2 of their 5 seasons and have been a borderline mighty program during the Modern Era. They were actually in decent shape heading into the final week of the regular season, simply needing to win their #RivalryWeek game against Joseph & Mike and to have Mitch beat a mediocre Gaudet & Cameron roster. Nick & Mickey took care of business. But the ZJs surprisingly took care of rivarly week and qualified themselves ahead of Nick & Mickey for the Playoffs. So the Nick & Mickey franchise was that close to making noise in the Playoffs in 2019. They entered the Consolation Ladder as the highest seed and proceeded to get brutally crushed in round 1 by their rivals, and then crushed again in round 2 by a resurgent Doug franchise.</p>
<p>While Kmish does have a Sacko on record (2011), this franchise has been on a valiant run ever since. It's scattered four top-4 finishes (2012, 2014, 2016, 2017) and is tied for second with 5 Playoff appearances since beginning of the Expansion Era. It entered the Consolation Ladder as the #9 seed which meant that a win at any time would eliminate any chance of a Sacko appearance. 69 points in round 1 resulted in defeat against Crockett, however, and 123 points in round 2 wasn't enough to best RTRO.</p>
<p>Here we are with two 6-7 teams in the Sacko Game. A 6-7 team had made the Playoffs in each of the past 3 seasons, and a 6-7 team even won the 2016 Playoff Championship. Unlucky to go 6-7 in '19 and find yourself fighting for your MWM life in the Sacko Game. Although it might feel super unlucky to be 6-7 and in the Sacko, imagine how it would feel to be 7-6 and LOSE the Sacko (2015 Mitch 7-6 Sacko). Since then, Sackos have been 3-10 (Doug 2016 Sacko), 5-8 (Gaudet & Cameron 2017 Sacko), and 4-9 (Scott & James 2018 Sacko).</p>
<p>Kfish is projected to win this matchup 123.7 - 120.6. There is a surprising number of Saturday night games for both teams, and then it'll all come down to Nick & Mickey's Davante Adams' MNF performance.</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://www.kylelogic.com/predictions2019">2019 Predictions</a> article, we had Nick & Mickey defeating Kmish in the Playoff Championship. Well, we couldn't be further from a championship here, but it almost feels like that sort of atmosphere with a -1 MWM on the line.</p>
