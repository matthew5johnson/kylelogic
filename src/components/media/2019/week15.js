<h3>Playoffs</h3>
<br></br>
<p>The four playoff teams in action this week each have a 66% chance of qualifying for the MWM 2020 Stage. The two teams with byes have a ~75% chance of qualifying for MWM.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h4>#1 Matt & Ross vs #4 Blake</h4>
<p>In our first semifinal, Matt & Ross get what's probably their toughest challenge of the year. Blake's squad is full of killers that have been tearing everything apart recently. Blake's three point victory over Mitch last weekend was the first Playoff win in Blake franchise history.</p>
<p>Blake is projected to win this 140 - 133. Have we ever seen a game projected to be this high scoring?</p>
<p>Matt & Ross got Blake in the double this season (weeks 1 and 12). If I told you that Blake scored 129 and 138 in those two matchups, you probably wouldn't guess he went 0-2. Matt & Ross scored 194.6 in week 1 and 152.5 in the week 12 matchup. The Butlers are pursuing a 2019 sweep of the Blake franchise. Remember that Playoff tiebreakers are determined by aggregate score from regular season matchups in case we have to invoke such a rule here.</p>
<p>This will be a Thursday Night delight with Lamar Jackson (Blake) going against Robby Anderson (Butlers). And should we take a moment of respect for how significant a move Blake's trade to acquire Lamar ended up being on his season?</p>
<p>David Montgomery is the only weakness on the Blake roster. The receiving corps of Anderson, Golladay, Diggs plus Jared Cook is probably the weakness for Matt & Ross. Can the fantasy god combo of CMC+Derrick Henry nudge the Butlers ahead this weekend?</p>
<p>The winner of this game qualifies for the 2020 MWM Stage and this season's Playoff Championship Game. The loser will have a chance to qualify for the 2020 MWM Stage by winning the 3rd Place Game next week.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>#2 Kyle vs #6 Gaudet & Cameron</h4>
<p>It's perplexing that the Gaudet & Cameron franchise has made it this far. Entering week 12, ZJs would need a 2-game winning streak plus a lot of external luck to make the playoffs. They won in week 12 only scoring 84.6 points. Then they won in week 13 scoring 145. They ended up being the lowest scoring 7-win team, but were lucky enough that the first Consolation Ladder franchise only managed 6 wins. So into the Playoffs ZJs went. In Round 1 they got a total of 13 points from their two RBs and 5 points out of their flex, yet somehow scored 133 to knock off Scott & James and advance to the semifinals. </p>
<p>The Kyle franchise is on the biggest stage its ever seen. It's projected to win this game 125 - 114. It looks like this game will likely come down to Monday Night Football.</p>
<p>DTTW looks like the better roster, but only because ZJ's Edelman, Darius Slayton, and Christian Kirk ... and Raheem Mostert and DeAndre Washington sounds like a Sacko Game squad through and through. ZJs will be falling back on Kyler Murray, Travis Kelce, and the Steelers defense.</p>
<p>Kyle can rely on Deshaun Watson, Joe Mixon, Kenyan Drake, Adam Thielen, and Jarvis to carry the load. It's tough to see a clear path to a ZJs victory when comparing position to position.</p>
<p>The winner of this game qualifies for the 2020 MWM Stage and this season's Playoff Championship Game. The loser will have a chance to qualify for the 2020 MWM Stage by winning the 3rd Place Game next week.</p>
<br></br>

<p>The TPC vs Mitch game this week doesn't count for anything. They play each other next week in the 5th Place Game, the winner of which will qualify for the 2020 MWM Stage.</p>

<br></br>
<h3>Consolation Ladder</h3>
<br></br>

<h4>Crockett vs Joseph & Mike</h4>
<p>Both of these franchises have played their way to Sacko safety. The winner of this game is into the Consolation Ladder Championship, and a shot at qualifying for the 2020 MWM Stage. The worst case scenario is a loss that'll put the loser into the 9th Place Game. No Sacko to worry about this season for these two.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Doug vs Nick & Mickey</h4>
<p>Outside of the two Playoff semifinals, this is the most meaningful game. The winner gets to play for the Consolation Ladder Championship and the right to qualify for the 2020 MWM Stage. The loser is playing for the Sacko. That's some extreme variance.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>Kmish vs RTRO</h4>
<p>The best case scenario is avoidance of a Sacko Game appearance. Win and you're into the 9th Place Game. Lose and you're in the Sacko Game. Kmish and RTRO are the first two franchises to be officially eliminated from the 2020 MWM Stage.</p>
