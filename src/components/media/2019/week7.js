                        <h3>TPC top the Standings, TBH top the Table, and Nick & Mickey have the most total points scored</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Our Major Competitions have started to take shape after six weeks of play. Scott & James are #1 in the Playoff Standings for the 5th week in franchise history, with 3 of those weeks logged in 2019. They've scored 803.2 total points through six weeks which is their first time over 800 points in six weeks since 2016 (839.9) when they made it to the Playoff Championship Game.</p> 
<p>TBH yet again sits atop their own competition, the Finch Howe League Cup, although what was a commanding 3 Point lead last week is now just 1. Plus, Mitch and Nick & Mickey have the top of the table in sight at just 3 Points behind. Everything can be shuffled in merely one week of play.</p>
<p>Nick & Mickey pace the league in total points scored with 836.9, barely edging out their rival Joseph & Mike by less than 2 points.</p>

<br></br>
<p>This is the last week 7 we'll ever have without an MWM Stage matchup. This year's 5th Place franchise will face off against the Consolation Bracket Winner in the first round of the 2020 MWM Stage exactly one year from now.</p>
<p>If MWM had been implemented at the beginning of last season, we'd have a Matt & Ross vs RTRO MWM game this weekend.</p>

<br></br>
<p>There was a GroupMe request for the Doug franchise's last 4-game losing streak. Ask and you shall receive.</p>
<p>The Doug franchise is in the midst of its first 4-game losing streak since 2016. It actually suffered two separate 4-game losing streaks in 2016 (weeks 2-5 and 10-13).</p>
<p>Prior to its recent Modern Era dominance, the Doug franchise had never qualified for the Playoffs and was statistically trailing DTTW in every major category. It has only endured three separate 4-game losing streaks in its history, although has experienced five occasions of 3-game losing streaks, and at least one of those streaks per season in the old Expansion Era.</p>
<p>The Kyle franchise has the most 4-game losing streaks with 7, while TPC is right behind with 6. The script has flipped in 2019 with those two franchises performing well and Doug struggling.</p>  

<br></br>
<p>Last week's league-wide 118.82 PPG was the 34th highest scoring week out of 70 Modern Era weeks.</p>   
<br></br>

            <h5>Week 7</h5>
            <p>It's safe to say that Scott & James are having their best season in franchise history. A lot of fantasy yet to be played, but they couldn't have dreamt up a better start.</p>
            <p>Mitch is the only franchise in the top-4 of the current Standings with a Playoff Championship adorning its halls. You'd have to say that Scott & James, Joseph & Mike, and especially Kyle are all big time upstarts. It would be epic if all three could remain in contention for their first Playoff 'Ship this season.</p>
            <p>We find many more traditional blue bloods loitering in the 3-3 tier. Nick & Mickey still need some hardware to continue their ascent, but the other three have all been well established for more than a decade. There are six Playoff Championships between both Matt & Ross and Gaudet & Cameron, and Kmish has been one of the most reliably consistent franchises we've had. With the upstarts forming the early top-tier of performers, it'll be interesting to see if they eventually get displaced by the traditional powers who have gotten off to slower starts.</p>
            <p>Doug, Blake, and Crockett are all still very much in the hunt. The tier of sadness includes a lone franchise this week.</p>

        <h5>Week 7</h5>
        <p>IT'S GETTING GOOD. Joseph & Mike, Scott & James, Mitch, and Nick & Mickey are separated by 3 Cup Points or less. Doug, Matt & Ross, and Kyle already have 8 Points and are well within reach as well.</p>
        <p>The past four theoretical Cup winners would have scored 32, 25, 27, and 27 League Cup Points. With seven weeks left in the FHLC competition this season, that means a maximum of 21 Points remain to be gained.</p>
        <p>It's probably safe to assume that the Crockett franchise and its 1 Point is eliminated at this point (22 Points is the best it can do).</p>
        <p>The four franchises with 5 or 6 Points probably aren't eliminated yet, but their situations will immediately turn dire for anybody that comes away without a result this week.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>Crockett, Doug, and Scott & James all had 20+ D/ST performances. Three such performances in the same week ties our league record. It's happened in five different weeks now, and we've never seen four 20+ D/ST scores in the same week.</p></li>
    <li><p>Joseph & Mike got 26.1 points from Austin Hooper, their 3rd best TE performance in franchise history (Travis Kelce 32.8 in 2016 week 6, Jimmy Graham 30.7 in 2016 week 9). They started two TEs, Kelce and Graham, in weeks 10 and 11 of that season. Sheesh</p></li>
    <li><p>Would you believe that Joseph & Mike's 44.9 from Matt Ryan was their best QB performance in franchise history? Well it is. And it's their 7th 40+ point QB performance in their four years as a franchise. RTRO has 5 40+ point QB performances in more than eight years as a franchise.</p></li>
    <li><p>Gaudet & Cameron notch their first weekly high-score since 2014!!! Since the institution of the $10 low/high, ZJs are now only net -$90.</p></li>
    <li><p>ZJ's also got their 3rd best RB1 performance of the Modern Era (James Conner's 29.5). Kyler's 39.3 would have nudged into the record books of most franchises, but ZJs are our league's QB whisperers with nine 40+ point QB performances in the Modern Era alone. Their 57.0 from Brees last season remains the #3 all-time best QB performance in the league history (Drew Brees 61.3 - Garner & Doyle 2015 week 8)</p></li>
    <li><p>Kfish locks in the weekly-low for a fourth time since the start of 2017, and the first time since week 1 of last season.</p></li>
    <li><p>Kfish got 4.1 from Gardner Minshew II ... third worst in franchise history, although nothing will ever beat Kfish's -2.3 points from Goff in week 14 of last season (all-time worst QB week in league history).</p></li>
    <li><p>Nick & Mickey got 29.9 from Nick Chubb. It doesn't register since they've had TWENTY 30+ point RBs.</p></li>
    <li><p>Matt & Ross get the #4 best WR performance in franchise history from Diggs's 44.1 this week. It's their 2nd best WR finish during the Modern Era behind AJ Green's '15 week 3 45.7 points. AJ was started in the flex just as Diggs was this week.</p></li>
    <li><p>Blake got the 5th best QB output in franchise history from Lamar Jackson's 37.1 points</p></li>
    <li><p>Blake had his first week with less than 100 points-against in 8 games.</p></li>
    <li><p>Recall that Blake faced 155.0 PPG-against through 5 weeks, the most of all-time. That's mercifully down to 142.6 PPG-against through 6 weeks.</p></li>
    <li><p>... which is still the Modern Era record for PPG-against through six weeks, but at least it's only 5th worst all-time now. You'd expect this number to continue reverting to the mean.</p></li>
    <li><p>The last time DTTW found itself top-4 in the Standings this late in the season was in 2016. It finished that season on a 7-game losing streak. Is this time different?</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 7 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Matt & Ross (3-3) vs Kyle (4-2):</h3> 7 wins has been good enough for playoff qualification in all 4 Modern Era seasons. A win this week would put the Kyle franchise just two wins away from its first ever playoff qualification. Should we start the countdown? Matt & Ross have CMC on bye this week, so they'll probably need another 30+ point performance from Diggs to stay competitive in this matchup. Any sort of League Cup Points result this week for either franchise would be massive as they both sit just below the top of the Table.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Blake (2-4) vs Crockett (2-4):</h3> Neither of these franchises is eliminated from Playoff Championship contention yet, but it sure looks like Crockett has fallen out of the League Cup race already. Blake is projected for 138.6 pts (!!) this week as he welcomes Tyreek back. Crockett will see Blake's Tyreek and raise Saquon. This matchup looks highly intriguing despite the records, and the winner will emerge as a playoff contender despite a slow start to the season. As noted last week, this Blake roster doesn't look like your typical sub-.500 squad, and layer on top of that the fact that he won't be facing 140 PPG-against every week. A win this week would give the Blake franchise three 3-4 starts in four seasons. Crockett has only once started worse than 3-4 (2-5 in 2018). Eight teams have started 2-5 in the Modern Era, and only one of those has ever made the playoffs - Crockett last season.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Scott & James (5-1) vs Doug (2-4):</h3> Here's the test for TPC! Their 2nd round pick is on bye as they face the defending Playoff Champion ... and they're probably 3 wins away from playoff qualification. A win this week is important for playoff bye implications. Bad news for Doug: Doug has lost what seems like 4 weeks in a row on either SNF or MNF. His entire roster will once again be done on Sunday afternoon, and he'll have to watch Tom Brady slowly chase him down on MNF. It hasn't been a fun season for the Doug franchise, a trend that might continue into week 7.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Mitch (4-2) vs Kfish (3-3):</h3> Two solid franchises holding their ground in the middle of the Standings. But the FHLC Table tells a completely different story. Mitch's 11 Cup Points put him only 2 behind the top of the Table, making it possible for him to claim the top spot with a 3 Point result this week. Kmish, on the other hand, sits at #11 on the Table with 5 Points. It'll take an improbable run of results to get him back into the FHLC picture. It looks like Mitch will employ the heavy set this week with dual TEs. Mike Evans and DJ Moore are both on bye. Kfish will need a healthy Kamara to stand a chance against that Bears defense in Blake's hometown.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Gaudet & Cameron (3-3) vs Nick & Mickey (3-3):</h3> ZJs 3-3 record through six weeks is their best since 2015. Nick & Mickey's 3-3 record is their worst since 2016, but their 139.4 PPG is by far a franchise best through 6 games. This is a similar setup to the Kmish vs Mitch matchup above in that Nick & Mickey are right at the top of the Table while ZJs are stuck at the bottom. There are no bye weeks or obvious injuries of note, so we'll get a strength on strength matchup in what could prove to be a statification game between two playoff hopefuls.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Joseph & Mike (4-2) vs RTRO (1-5):</h3> TBH is off to a roaring start for the third time in five years. Through six games, they've averaged 146.3 PPG in 2016, 138.1 PPG in 2018, and 139.2 PPG this season. The combined results of the Joseph & Mike/Nick & Mickey rivalry continue to dominate the league. Remember that TBH is coming off of an overall #2 playoff finish last season. They're projected for an astounding 140.6 points this week and have no notable players on bye. Joseph & Mike should add another 3 Points to their League Cup performance and cruise to another win to remain in contention for a playoff bye. RTRO had never been below 0.500 through six weeks in any season during its existence. It has posted 108 PPG and has no hope with its 2nd and 3rd round picks both on bye this week. Looking forward to fighting for MWM qualification in the Consolation Bracket.</p>
