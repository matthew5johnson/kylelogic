<p>
Last year some notable records were obliterated, Doug won another championship, Matt & Ross brought home another consolation bracket championship, Mitch notched a second consecutive top-3 finish, Crockett and Kmish made the playoffs…again, Blake beat his rival Scott & James in an epic Sacko, Joseph & Mike figured out how to play magical fantasy defense, and you already know that the Kyle franchise was toiling in the consolation bracket for a 9th season in a row. Let's dig in to some of these storylines, shall we?
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Single Week Scoring Record</h3>
<h4>The 200 point week</h4>
<br></br>
<p>
It’s difficult to overstate the rarity of a 200-point week. RTRO blazed the trail way back in 2012 with its 202.9-point week 2. The Kyle franchise would be the second to break the 200 seal by scoring 208.3 points in 2013. And Gaudet & Cameron became just the third franchise to do it with their 201.7 points in 2014. Those three performances had stood as the only three 200+ point gems ever, and Kyle’s 208.3-point record had remained untouched for FOUR years. With the scoring dilution that resulted from 10- to 12-team Modern Era expansion, the Kyle franchise’s scoring record was looking more unbreakable with each passing season  … until week 6 of last year when RTRO scored 210.9 points to break the previously unbreakable record, and notch only the fourth 200+ point performance in history (the franchise’s 2nd such accomplishment). 
</p>
<p>
Then, every conception of a high-scoring week was shattered a mere 4 weeks later. Week 10 rolled around and the annals of history had to be recalibrated entirely. When the dust settled on that fateful week 10, the Crockett franchise had posted a mind boggling 225.2 points on the back of a QB putting up 46, two RBs each putting up 30+, a WR putting up 30+, and a TE nearly getting 40. 
</p>
<p>
225.2 points in a single week is complete insanity.
</p>
<p>
Fun fact: Massive blowouts are usually only possible when an opponent scores less than 100 points. Of the top 20 biggest blowouts, only 1 opponent scored more than 107. That was Kmish’s powerful 133 points against Crockett in this very matchup, and yet the 91.7-point margin of victory goes down as the #13 biggest blowout in league history.
</p>
<p>
Another fun fact: This matchup combined for a total of 358.7 points. That’s the second highest matchup total in history, 0.2 points behind the 2014 #NeverForget RTRO vs Kyle matchup.
</p>
<p>
We enter 2019 having seen an infinitesimal 0.18% of scores reach the sacred 200+ mark, and therefore the Crockett franchise likely holding onto the single-week scoring record for many, many seasons to come. Is this record The Krewe’s version of Barry Bonds’ 73 HRs, or is it closer to Wilt’s 100-point game?
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Season Scoring Record</h3>
<h4>"Diamond Season"</h4>
<br></br>
<p>
The single-season scoring record is one of the most respected measures of greatness that we have. If a single week of 200+ points is a gem, then a 140+ PPG season is a rare diamond, forged through an entire year of brilliance. Some of the seasons that would go on our Mount Rushmore of performances didn’t even touch 140 PPG – Garner & Doyle scored 134.86 PPG en route to their superb 2013 championship, ZJs scored a massive 137.29 PPG during their 2014 championship run, and RTRO posted 134.25 PPG to win the first championship of the Modern Era. Kmish achieved a franchise record-best finish (3rd place) on the back of an incredible 135.02 PPG season in 2012, the fourth best scoring season in Expansion Era history, and still eighth best all-time. All of these scoring averages are monument worthy, yet none even approach the 140+ PPG diamond.
</p>
<p>
To get a glimpse of the 140+ PPG enigma, we’ll have to start by journeying back to 2011. The league had moved out of the stone age and into the Expansion Era by adding a 9th and 10th franchise (Mitch and RTRO). Scoring dilution was sure to mix things up after everyone had become accustomed to the tiny high-scoring 8-team league. But then the Mitch franchise welcomed everyone to new Era. You might want to prepare yourself for some of these stats, because its unreal.
</p>
<p>
Mitch put up a Golden Season that year. A Golden Season occurs when a franchise scores 100 or more points in every week for the entire year, a rare feat only having been accomplished 7 times, and just a single time during the Modern Era. Mitch’s worst single-game score in 2011 was 104.1. The league-wide scoring average that season was 122.68. The only week in which Mitch scored less than that average was his 104.1-point week. That’s 15 weeks of 123+, 12 weeks of 130+, and 7 weeks of 150+. Tom Brady started for him in 15/16 weeks averaging 30.62 points per week, scoring more than 30 points in 9 of those starts. Jimmy Graham started for him in 15/16 weeks averaging 17.34 points per week, scoring more than 20 points in 6 of those. Arian Foster broke out that season, Wes Welker was putting up 51 points in his flex during week 3, Roddy White scored 20+ in 5 of the last 6 games, and Mitch rode all of this to a 50+ point victory over Garner & Doyle in the semifinal, and a 60+ point demolition of the Crockett franchise in the league championship game.
</p>
<p>
This is what fantasy looks like in god-mode. It was such a comprehensively dominant performance that it got Mitch to a then-record 12 wins. His juggernaut of a roster put up an astounding 143.45 regular season PPG, and finished strong in the playoffs to bring his final scoring average to 145.12 PPG diamond status, which stood as the only season scoring average above 138.
</p>
<p>
For more than half a decade, the two closest contenders to Mitch’s impossible record of 145.12 PPG (2011) were RTRO’s 137.95 PPG (2011), ZJ’s 137.29 PPG (2014), and Kmish’s 135.02 (2012). Nobody was even coming close to 138 PPG in more recent years, much less the outlandish 140+ PPG diamond that had only been accomplished by Mitch’s cunning in ‘11.
</p>
<p>
Then came the Doug franchise in 2017. Let’s have a look back at how Doug’s 2017 season was summed up in last year’s review article: 
</p>
<p>
“After a suffering as the 2016 Sacko, but being accidentally spared the mandated punishment of a last-place draft choice, we might have witnessed the most flawless draft in CrewFFL history. Doug nailed nearly every one of his picks which resulted in a veritable fantasy monstrosity - the #1 QB, #3 TE, 2 top RBs, 2 top WRs, a high floor flex WR, and the #1 defense/ST. His week 7 trade for Julio all but sealed the deal. 
</p>
<p>
Doug started with 4 consecutive weeks of 140+ points, 2 standard deviations above the league-wide scoring average. In the most crucial weeks, playoff round 2 and round 3 following his bye, he scored 170 and 155 points respectively. When all was said and done, the Doug franchise had set the modern era's scoring record (141.3 PPG) while nearly knocking off the ALL TIME scoring record, set back in the high scoring 10 team expansion era. His average margin of victory (34 points) almost DOUBLED the previous record of 20 points.”
</p>
<p>
“Only” averaging 137.98 PPG during the regular season in 2017, the Doug franchise had to put on a postseason for the ages if it was to become the second franchise with diamond status. It did. Doug’s 141.3 PPG became the second ever team to join Mitch in the 140+ PPG diamond club, and would set the Modern Era scoring record.
</p>
<p>
There we were, entering the 2018 season having been lucky enough to see two historic 140+ PPG seasons over the past decade.
</p>
<p>
But lightning would strike once again in 2018. RTRO would combine excellent draft execution with extreme roster activity (#3 most roster moves in history) to post the most prolific regular season of all-time, beating Mitch’s 2011 143.45 PPG unbeatable record by more than 2 points-per-game, with 145.89 PPG. RTRO would then go on to crush Doug’s 2017 full-season 141.33 PPG by more than 2.5 points-per-game, with 143.87 PPG.
</p>
<p>
When all was said and done, the Modern Era’s single-season scoring record was reset to 143.87 PPG, and the all-time regular season scoring record was shattered. 
</p>
<p>
We’ve now seen three 140+ PPG diamond seasons as we head into 2019. Will we see another franchise join Mitch, Doug, and RTRO in the diamond club this year?
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>GOAT Fantasy Defense</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
Joseph & Mike figured out the whole fantasy defense thing. They rode this newfound fantasy defense to a 10-0 start, tying the all-time win streak record. On the one hand, they faced opponents who scored fewer than 100 points a whopping 7 times. On the other hand, they themselves scored below league average in 11 of their 15 games! Despite finishing the regular season 0-3 and being #8 in scoring (121.78 PPG), they snuck into the 2 seed and a playoff bye. TBH then proceeded to flex their fantasy D on the biggest stage by knocking off the Crockett franchise 95.5 to 81.6 in the semifinals, becoming the first ever franchise to win a playoff game while scoring less than 100 points. The magic predictably ended the next week when they put up 101.4 points to hand Doug a 60+ point victory and another ring. But the Joseph & Mike franchise now has a #2 and #3 finish to their name during four years in the league.
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Back-to-back</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
Another Modern Era season, another great performance by the Doug franchise. This was his 3rd championship game appearance in 4 years (2015, 2017, 2018), second consecutive regular season title (2017, 2018), second consecutive league championship (2017, 2018), and second top-5 all-time scoring season. Good luck to whoever has to play this franchise in the Double this year...
</p>
<p>
The Doug franchise’s 2018 championship can be summarized as follows: Doug took LeVeon Bell with the first overall pick, and LeVeon proceeded to party in Miami for the entire year. He took Patrick Mahomes in the 11th round, and Mahomes proceeded to rewrite every QB record in the books. James Conner in the 13th round stepped in to produce LeVeon-lite numbers. Unlike in 2017, Doug didn’t have a whole lot to build around from the draft, so he was forced to fall back on his roster brilliance and to grind out the season. It started with the essential requirement of trading draft picks (only one past champion neglected to trade draft picks), then saw him jump into the upper echelon of free agency activity (38 free agency moves, #5 in the league), and ultimately resulted in the activation of 122 different players (#2 only behind ZJ’s 126 activations). The skill to maneuver his roster was never more evident than in week 3 when George Kittle was acquired over the Crockett franchise’s 2nd highest bid, and arguably served as the cornerstone piece of Doug’s second championship.
</p>
<p>
In 2017 the Doug franchise won through the draft. In 2018 the Doug franchise won in exactly the opposite way – by winning free agency. A diverse skillset on full display.
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Consolation Heaven</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
2018 was the third consecutive consolation bracket for the Matt & Ross franchise, but they’ve made the most of the experience by bringing home back-to-back consolation bracket championships. As was said in the article earlier this week, winning the consolation bracket is a really big deal in 2019 and beyond now that it gets you qualification into the next MWM Stage.
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Draft</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
Kmish has always done a superb job of both scheduling drafts for availability and catering to convenience by using google sheets as draft boards. As long as you have internet access, you can draft from the four corners of Earth. That’s what made it so disappointing when Mitch couldn’t make the draft last year due to work obligations. It was our first and hopefully last auto-draft in league history. Despite the disappointment, the Mitch franchise came out of the draft with enough assets to work its way into a #3 overall finish on the shoulders of some shrewd free agency activity. A suggestion that might help to mitigate the chances of a missed draft recurrence could be for single-owner franchises to add a second owner to the front office.
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Consistency</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
The Crockett franchise now holds the longest active streak for playoff appearances with 4. That ties Matt & Ross (’12-’15) and RTRO (’13-’16), giving Crockett a chance to set the all-time consecutive playoff streak record this season. Crockett and RTRO are tied for most playoff appearances with 6, just ahead of Kmish and Mitch who are tied with 5. Coincidentally, Kmish and Mitch are both on active 3-season playoff streaks, meaning that playoff qualification by either of them could tie the record in 2019.
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Sacko Delight</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
Although Scott & James didn’t have an outright horrible year (#9 in scoring with 118.29 PPG), going 0-3 against their rival Blake (#12 in scoring with 106.17 PPG) and capping off the season with a 26.3-point rivalry loss in the Sacko is never going to feel good. It especially stings when the Blake franchise is more than an entire standard deviation below the league scoring average. While the NOOBs did sustain two “unlucky” losses (losing while scoring above the league average) during the regular season, 6 wins still wouldn’t have gotten them to the playoffs since they would have lost the points-scored tie breaker to Crockett anyway. 
</p>
<p>
Blake did unbelievably well to avoid losing the Sacko in a year that saw him post the 9th worst scoring performance in league history, 2nd worst regular season record of all-time (3-10), and 2nd worst start to the season ever (1-7 through the opening 8 games). The Blake franchise scored below league average in 12 of 13 regular season games, but rebounded to beat Kyle and Scott & James in the consolation bracket with 140.1 and 163.8 points respectively. Avoiding Sackos is super important for MWM purposes from now on, and even avoiding it last year keeps the blemish off of his heretofore clean franchise history.
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>A Fall from Grace</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
Entering 2018, there had been been four 4-0 starts in league history: 
</p>
<p>
4-0 RTRO ’15 finished #1, 4-0 Joseph & Mike ’16 finished #3, 4-0 Nick & Mickey ‘17 finished #3, and 4-0 Doug ‘17 finished #1. 
</p>
<p>
So, when the Nick & Mickey franchise started 4-0 for their second consecutive season, the trends suggested that there was no doubt they were on their way to another top 3 finish. However, it all went awry when they ran into the buzz saw that was the Joseph & Mike fantasy defense, who also happened to be 4-0 at the time (which means that 4 of the 6 undefeated starts in league history have now come from this rivalry alone). True to form, the TBH fantasy D held Nick & Mickey to just 111.3 points in what would be the start of a brutal 1-7 stretch, including a 5-game losing streak. Only one time did the Nick & Mickey franchise lose all season when scoring above league average. That makes it tough to attribute the letdown to anything other than a genuinely disappointing season. 
</p>
<p>
Joseph & Mike went on to add another data point to 4-0 starters with their #2 finish, and Nick & Mickey became the first undefeated team entering #RivalryWeek to finish outside of the top 3, missing the playoffs entirely.
</p>
<p>
Down seasons happen though. The Nick & Mickey franchise remains firmly in the top tier with its two impressive top-4 finishes (’15 and ’17) and fourth best average ranking (5.5). More telling, it stands alone at fourth in Modern Era scoring (123.55 PPG) with considerable daylight separating it from the next highest scoring franchise (#5 Kmish @ 120.17 PPG).
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Wild Playoff Race</h3>
<br></br>
<p>
Our 6-team playoff system continues to perform superbly, as each of the top-3 scoring teams yet again qualified for the playoffs. After four seasons, the 6-team playoff system is now 11 for 12 in ensuring that top-3 scoring teams qualify for the playoffs. Additionally, 81% of the teams who have scored 120+ PPG have qualified for the playoffs during the Modern Era. This has proven to be an ideal qualification system.
</p>
<p>
Arguably more importantly, the 6-team playoff bracket has created an insanely fun playoff race deep into the season. Not a single team was mathematically eliminated entering week 11, and only two had clinched playoff berths. Six franchises had begun to position themselves for the three remaining playoff spots by week 12, and we ultimately ended up with a 4-way tie for the #6 seed. Only one game separated seeds #4 through #9.
</p>
<p>
The 6-team bracket produces so much fun beyond just the playoffs because the entire league feels the pressure of being a playoff contender, even into weeks 11 and 12. 
</p>
<p>
5-stars. Great playoff system.  
</p>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>And now it's on to 2019</h2>
<br></br>
<p>
Everyone travel safely, whether you're flying or driving into the draft this weekend. The draft is scheduled for 12pm noon central standard time this Sunday, September 1st. 
</p>
<p>
This being the first year of Maze's Width Marathon, remember that week 16 performances now matter a whole lot for 2020 MWM Stage qualification. We'll do a dedicated MWM article as the postseason approaches.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy college football tonight through Saturday, and I'll see most everyone on Sunday. Doug's title defense starts in 3 days. Welcome to 2019 gentlemen.
