                        <h3>A Scoring Dud</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>There have only been 6 weeks in history in which league-wide scoring was less than 105 PPG. Last week was one of them.</p> 
<p>The headliner of course was the Mitch franchise scoring 43.8 points, good for worst week of all-time. The Kmish front office is ecstatic now that it no longer holds that dreary spot in the record books (43.9 in week 5 of 2015). But other franchises contributed with poor performances of their own - Nick & Mickey's 90.5 was 9th worst in franchise history, Gaudet & Cameron's 73.5 was 8th worst in franchise history, and Crockett's 73.0 was 3rd worst in franchise history.</p>
<p>The 92.5 point margin-of-victory of Kfish over Mitch was simultaneously Kfish's 2nd biggest blowout and Mitch's 2nd biggest loss in franchise history. Although it doesn't quite make it into the top-10 overall (#10 biggest blowout = 94.9)</p>

<br></br>
<p>Last week's round 1 of the MWM would have seen Matt & Ross advance to round 2 this week. Our MWM 2019 Stage semi-finals would have taken place this week and would have consisted of Matt & Ross vs Doug and Joseph & Mike vs Mitch.</p>
<p>If MWM had been implemented at the beginning of last season, we'd have a Matt & Ross vs RTRO MWM game this weekend.</p>

            <h5>Week 8</h5>
            <p>History continues yet again this week, as 2019 has really shaken things up. TPC sits atop the Playoff Standings for longer than they ever have, and RTRO sits at the bottom of the Standings for longer than they ever have. It's an upside down season that gives us a chance for fun shakeup.</p>
            <p>Add to that the fact that the bottom three franchises, which have combined to win every Playoff Championship of this Era, are all but mathematically eliminated from Playoff qualification already, and you get the biggest opportunity the other franchises have seen in recent memory.</p>
            <p>7 wins has guaranteed playoff qualification in each of the past three seasons. Scott & James are 1 win away and Joseph & Mike are 2 away. Both of these franchises might start scheming to get a playoff BYE.</p>
            <p>The middle of the Standings are still completely up in the air. Seven franchises have three or four wins and are competing for the final 4 remaining Playoff slots. Nick & Mickey and Matt & Ross are the only two of that group with 900+ points-scored, so they'll hold a significant advantage in tie-breakers. Kyle, Mitch, Kfish, Blake, and ZJs are all obviously in the hunt. Blake's roster still sure looks like a playoff roster to me...</p>

        <h5>Week 8</h5>
        <p>The People's Choice. 1 Point clear of TBH to regain top-of-the-table status. The top two are separating themselves from the field, now at 4 points clear of the trio of franchises with 11 Poitns.</p>
        <p>6 weeks and 18 possible League Cup Points remain. It's tough to see anything less than 25 Points being enough to win the Cup, so you'd have to figure ZJs, Crockett, and probably RTRO are eliminated.</p>
        <p>ZJs have gotten relatively fortunate in their head-to-head matchups to stay in the Playoff hunt at #9 in the Playoff Standings given their #11 position in the FHLC Table. On the flip side, Doug's 9 Points suggest he should be in a better position than #10 in the Playoff Standings with a 2-5 record.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>The Blake franchise gets its biggest blowout in franchise history after beating Crockett by 69. Blake's Darren Waller posted the seventh best TE1 performance of the Modern Era (Waller: 32.2).</p></li>
    <li><p>It was Blake's fourth time as weekly high-scorer. @bot money list to see how that affects the rankings</p></li>
    <li><p>The Crockett franchise started 4 pass catchers from which it got 16.6 total points. The draft strategy of eschewing WRs until later rounds is looking regrettable.</p></li>
    <li><p>Doug's losing streak is extended to five. 2019 is resembling the 2016 Doug Sacko year with each passing week.</p></li>
    <li><p>ZJ's Kyler Murray and his 10.5 points was the 6th worst QB performance in Modern franchise history.</p></li>
    <li><p>RTRO's kicker was determined to make our record books last week. His -1.0 point is the worst all-time kicking performance (tied with 6 others).</p></li>
    <li><p>RTRO's kickers and defenses have combined to average 8.8 PPG through seven weeks. That's the 4th worst of the Modern Era, and one of only four sub-10 averages. (Matt & Ross 7.5 in 2016, ZJs 8.4 in 2018, Garner & Doyle 8.4 in 2015)</p></li>
    <li><p>Joseph & Mike's 5-2 record is only their third best through seven weeks. That's how good they've been. 7-0 last year and 6-1 in 2016.</p></li>
    <li><p>Kmish gets 56.3 from Aaron Rodgers, good for fourth all-time and 3rd best of the Modern Era. Kmish has now started 3-4 or better for six consecutive seasons.</p></li>
    <li><p>DTTW is licking its wounds, now on a 2-game losing streak after a franchise-best start to the season.</p></li>
    <li><p>After 7 weeks, Matt & Ross were #1 in the Playoff Standings in 2012, #1 in 2013, and #2 in 2014. They're #4 this week, which is their best position in the Standings since 2014. The Butlers 131.2 PPG is their best since 2013. The Butlers are BACK.</p></li>
    <li><p>It's a "burn the tape and move on" week for the Mitch franchise. The all-time worst 43.8 point performance couldn't have happened without the whole roster busting, but the Lions Defense -7.0 stands out as being particularly atrocious. It's tied for the 3rd worst DST performance of all-time. Interestingly, Mitch also holds the record for this (Packers DST -9.0 in week 10 of 2016).</p></li>
    <li><p>We've talked about how rare winning is while scoring less than 100 points. Nick & Mickey had lost when scoring 143.6 and 153.1 in weeks 3 & 5 earlier this year, so they'll take the luck required to win scoring 90.5 this week.</p></li>
    <li><p>Nick & Mickey's 90.5 points was the 10th lowest point-total to still notch a win. Their 153.1 point week 5 was the 6th highest score to suffer a loss. Call it even now?</p></li>
    <li><p>Scott & James picked up the Patriots DST after week 1. Since then, the Pats have posted 37, 14, 25, 14, 27, 25.</p></li>
    <li><p>... in other words, their Pats DST is averaging 23.6 PPG. That breaks all of our stats. The closest DST to this in our record books is Scott & James' 2014 Packers DST, but they only averaged 14.7 PPG across four starts. TPC is getting an unprecedented record breaking performance from the Patriots this year.</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 8 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Kfish (4-3) vs Nick & Mickey (4-3):</h3> Huge playoff implications. It looks like Kmish gets Kamara back and Nick & Mickey get Davanta Adams back. This could be one of those matchups where both teams get 3 League Cup Points and one of them has to take the unlucky L.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Doug (2-5) vs Matt & Ross (4-3):</h3> It's a BRUTAL week for the Doug franchise, with Dak and Zeke on bye. And it comes at the very worst of times, exactly when Doug requires a win to stay in the playoff race and a result to stay in the FHLC. Matt & Ross are at full strength with delectable matchups across the board. This is the week The Butlers inch closer to a playoff spot.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Kyle (4-3) vs Blake (3-4):</h3> Kyle wins the FAAB bidding war of 2019 to land Ty Johnson. Hopefully it's enough to keep DTTW afloat this week with a couple eye-poppingly diffuclt matchups (Jarvis @ NE and Ekeler @ CHI). DTTW badly needs to put an end to this 2-game losing streak. Blake is without Lamar Jackson, but is still projected for 130+ with favorable matchups galore. If Mahomes is throwing bombs to Tyreek Hill this week, it's possible that the Blake roster survives without Lamar.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Scott & James (6-1) vs Mitch (4-3):</h3> A win this week would probably give TPC a playoff bid, but it won't be easy even though Mitch has both a starting RB and TE on bye. Jared Goff will either put up -10 or 55. Mike Evans will either put up 0 or 40. The Lions DST put up -7 last week. Mitch is hoping for a collective boom week from his squad.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Gaudet & Cameron (3-4) vs RTRO (1-6):</h3> No players on bye and both squads at full strength. ZJs need a win to keep pace in the Standings. Starting Kyler Murray in the Superdome is a frisky call, and DJ Chark + Darius Slayton at WR2 and Flex will be fascinating to watch.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Joseph & Mike (5-2) vs Crockett (2-5):</h3> Let's see if the Crockett franchise can remember to set a starting lineup this week. TBH is without Amari Cooper this week, but it shouldn't matter. They're still projected for 138+ points this week and should cruise to an easy victory yet again. Gurley against CIN and Cook against WAS is laughable. Joseph & Mike are taking advantage of the easier part of their schedule and stowing away wins for their difficult upcoming stretch run.</p>
