                        <h3>!! Matt & Ross win the 2019 Finch Howe League Cup !!</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Four contenders entered week 13 with 20 or more League Cup Points. It all came down to which of those four franchises could post 3 Points.</p> 
<p>Scott & James were #1 in the Playoff Standings as rececently as week 10, and hadn't fallen out of a Playoff bye slot since week 5 when they were #3 in the Playoff Standings. TPC had 19 League Cup Points in week 8 and was in position to run away with the FHLC. Yet it entered week 13 with 21 Points and could only muster 1 Point in yet another critical #Rivalry loss to Blake. The Blake franchise has now bludgeoned its way into the first Playoff appearance in franchise history, and in doing so knocks TPC out of a Playoff bye. TPC finishes the final stretch of the regular season with a 1-4 record. Blake finishes his Playoff push going 6-2 over the final 8 weeks.</p>
<p>Mitch entered the week with 21 Points as well, but fell flat against ZJs by scoring just 105 fantasy points. That failed to register a League Cup result.</p>
<p>Joseph & Mike came into week 13 with 20 League Cup Points, two off of the top of the Table and seemingly in good shape. But like TPC, TBH was only able to muster 1 League Cup Point.</p>
<p>While their competition was stumbling, Matt & Ross scored 132.5, good for a 3 Point result. That propelled The Butlers to 24 League Cup Points.</p>
<p>Matt & Ross have won the 2019 Finch Howe League Cup! Congratulations to The Butlers for winning their first hardware since 2012. They have earned entry into the 2020 Community Shield by virtue of winning the League Cup.</p>

<p>And now we're on to the Postseason ...</p>
<br></br>

<h3>Playoffs</h3>
<br></br>
<p>The four playoff teams in action this week each have a 66% chance of qualifying for the MWM 2020 Stage. The two teams with byes have a ~75% chance of qualifying for MWM.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h4>PLAYOFF BYES: #1 Matt & Ross and #2 Kyle</h4>
<p>Is this real life? In its first season qualifying for the Playoffs, DTTW earns a coveted bye. Kyle registers his first #RivalryWeek sweep in franchise history to finally overcome the #NeverForget curse. He's a single win away from qualifying for next year's MWM Stage and a berth in this year's Playoff Championship game. Wow.</p>
<p>Matt & Ross continue to ride an historic win-streak. It was already a franchise record last week at 6-games, and it's been extended to 7-games with their 2019 sweep of Crockett.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>#3 Scott & James vs #6 Gaudet & Cameron</h4>
<p>Gaudet & Cameron were able to barely sneak into the Playoffs. Since they would have lost the points-scored tiebreaker against both Nick & Mickey and Joseph & Mike, they had to beat Mitch while also hoping for Nick & Mickey to beat Joseph & Mike. As it turned out, week 13 couldn't have gone any better for the ZJs.</p>
<p>These two franchises met during week 10 in a super close 0.7 point ZJ victory.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>#4 Blake vs #5 Mitch</h4>
<p>The week 11 Tellarico Bowl whetted our appetite for what is unquestionably the most significant game in Blake franchise history. Mitch prevailed over Blake by a score of 115.8 - 113.6 in week 11. The kylelogic.com journalists have been steadfast in the belief that Blake's roster looked like a Playoff contender. And here we are.</p>
<p>Mitch has made the Playoffs four years in a row, tying the record held by RTRO, Matt & Ross, and Crockett.</p>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<h3>Consolation Ladder</h3>
<br></br>
<p>The Consolation Ladder Champion gains access to next year's Maze's Width Marathon Stage. The Sacko suffers the tremendous burden of having to win three Stages to win the Marathon. The risk reward in this Ladder is extreme.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h4>#7 Nick & Mickey vs #8 Joseph & Mike</h4>
<p>A #RivalryWeek rematch between two franchises that sustained lots of disappointment last week. Both were hoping to make the Playoffs.</p>
<p>The winner of this game will be one win away from making it into the Consolation Ladder Championship game in week 16, and removes the possibility of playing in the Sacko. The loser of this game will be one loss away from the Sacko Bowl. Although the big benefit of being a top-2 seed in the Consolation Ladder is that even if you lose your first game, you can win your second game and be in week 16's Consolation Ladder Championship game.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>#9 Kfish vs #10 Crockett</h4>
<p>The winner of this game plays the winner of the Nick & Mickey/Joseph & Mike game, and cannot play in the Sacko.</p>
<p>The loser of this game is eliminated from being able to qualify for the Consolation Ladder Championship, and is then only one loss away from being in the Sacko.</p>
<br></br>

<h4>#11 Doug vs #12 RTRO</h4>
<p>In order for Doug or RTRO to make it all the way up to the Consolation Ladder Championship, they'll have to win both this week and next week.</p>
<p>Regardless of outcome in this matchup, both teams will have to win their matchups next week to avoid participating in the Sacko. That's why this is the "quicksand" game.</p>
