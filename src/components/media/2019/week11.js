                        <h3>TPC Being Chased Down</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>TPC had secured a seemingly comfortable lead by week 7. Multiple games safe in the Playoff Standings and multiple Points safe at the top of the Table.</p>
<p>But as we enter week 11, The Butlers have caught TPC at the top of the Playoff Standings and TBH has caught them on the FHLC Table. The Scott & James franchise needs to capitalize on an easy matchup this week if they hope to keep their magical ride going.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Last week's league-wide scoring average of 120.5 PPG is the 6th highest scoring week of the season.</p>

<br></br>
<p>RTRO ties the all-time best losing streak (8 games) and is on pace for the worst fantasy defense of the Modern Era. Facing 132.9 PPG-against over 16 weeks would go down as the 4th most all-time</p>

            <h5>Week 11</h5>
            <p>If anything, last week led to more confusion atop the Playoff Standings. We now have roughly a top-four consisting of 6 and 7 win teams all past the 1,300 points-scored threshold. Those are Scott & James, Matt & Ross, Joseph & Mike, and Blake. Surprise surprise .. Blake is in the hunt.</p>
            <p>The Kyle franchise is in tier 2 by itself since it's still more than 60 points away from clearing the 1,300 points-scored barrier, thus probably being multiple weeks away from snagging that tie-breaker. But it sure is looking good for a first ever DTTW Playoff qualification!</p>
            <p>In tier 3 are the four 5-5 teams: Nick & Mickey, Mitch, Gaudet & Cameron, and Crockett. Nick & Mickey lead Mitch by ~50 points, who leads Gaudet & Cameron by ~50 points, who lead Crockett by ~60 points. If we assume that the five teams in tiers 1 & 2 will make the Playoffs, that means there will only be room for 1 team from this tier. Points scored are going to be a crucial tie-breaker this season with such a tight tier 3, and it's tough to see a way back for the Crockett franchise down by ~200 points with three weeks to play.</p>
            <p>Tier 4 is Kmish alone. His 1,153 total points would be competitive with the lower two teams in tier 3, but his 4-6 record is a deal breaker this late in the season. With so many 5-5 teams entering week 11, the 6 seed is almost certainly going to need 7 wins, which means Kmish needs to win out.</p>

        <h5>Week 11</h5>
        <p>Here we are again with the namesake of this esteemed competition atop the Table. Yes, it's based on the total-points tie-breaker, but TBH takes it any way they can get it.</p>
        <p>TPC had such a promising lead, up a full 3 Points just two weeks ago. How quickly things change.</p>
        <p>9 Points remain to be had in the fight to raise the Finch Howe League Cup. Blake, Matt & Ross, and Mitch are all 5 Points off of our leaders. Let's see who can handle the pressure down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Running the numbers for hypothetical League Cups for every season of the Modern Era shows that the lowest Point total would have belonged to 2015 Kyle (5 Points) while second lowest would have been 2018 Blake (6 Points). This season's iteration of the Crockett franchise has surpassed these low marks with its 7 Points as we currently stand. Although the race is on by the bottom 3 teams to get to 10 Points.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>The Patriots were on bye, so Scott & James had to plug in the Ravens DST as a fill-in. They scored 24.0 ... TPC is now getting 18.7 PPG from its DST through 10 weeks, by FAR the most all time (2012 Doug 14.5 PPG; M.E. 2017 Doug 11.0)</p></li>
    <li><p>Matt & Ross set the record for most times having a DST score 20+ back in 2013, with 4 weeks out of 16. TPC has already gotten 6 20+ defensive performances in 10 weeks. How badly will they break the season-long record?</p></li>
    <li><p>The Blake franchise has scored below 120.0 points twice this season, and is in line to post a Golden Season (no week below 100.0)!</p></li>
    <li><p>Blake has scored 130+ in four straight weeks</p></li>
    <li><p>Crockett has faced four sub-100 scores this season. That's a lot of free wins, but it pales in comparison to the legendary TBH fantasy defense of 2018 which faced 6 sub-100 scores in its first 10 weeks of play</p></li>
    <li><p>The Doug franchise posted 75.0 points in its worst showing of the Modern Era, and third worst performance all-time (2013 68.8 and 2011 69.2)</p></li>
    <li><p>ZJs closest victory came by 0.3 points against Kyle in 2017. Their 0.8 point victory over Matt & Ross in week 3 of this season was their second closest win in franchise history. Until this week when they squeezed past Scott & James by 0.7 points. 2019 has been a nailbiter for the still alive & kicking Gaudet & Cameron franchise.</p></li>
    <li><p>By virtue of facing off against Doug's historically low 75 points this week, Joseph & Mike are able to record the third largest margin of victory in franchise history (57.8)</p></li>
    <li><p>Kmish has only scored 120+ once in the last five weeks. He's 0-4 scoring less than 120 and 1-0 when scoring above 120 during that span. It's going to take three straight weeks of 120+ if the Kmish franchise expects to make the Playoffs.</p></li>
    <li><p>The last time DTTW was 6-4 was 2011. The last time DTTW as #5 in the Playoff Standings after ten weeks was 2016. #NeverForget</p></li>
    <li><p>The Butlers get an extreme up and down performance in week 10. Brian Hoyer scores 4.7, good for the 5th fewest points by a QB in Matt & Ross franchise history. But they get spectacular RB performances to make up for it.</p></li>
    <li><p>Matt & Ross entered the season having seen both their RB1 and RB2 score 25+ in the same week two times ever. 2013 Shane Vereen & Jamaal Charles and 2017 Jordan Howard & Rod Smith.</p></li>
    <li><p>They've added two more dualing 25+ RB performances in 2019. Both were by CMC and Derrick Henry. Week 1 and last week.</p></li>
    <li><p>It seems like we were just talking about Mahomes putting up an historical performance for the Mitch franchise. Well, Mahomes' 43.8 does it again and slots into 4th best in Mitch franchise history.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cooper Kupp's surprising 0.0 points single handedly cost Nick & Mickey a victory this week. They've uncharacteristically scored less than 100 in 3 weeks so far this season. They had 2 TOTAL sub-100 weeks over their past three seasons combined.</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 11 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Matt & Ross (7-3) vs Nick & Mickey (5-5):</h3> 3 Points would be MASSIVE for the Butlers here. With Russ and Davante Adams both on bye, you have to figure Nick & Mickey are going to struggle to keep up this week. A Matt & Ross win would put Nick & Mickey right on the edge of Playoff consideration while The Butlers would potentially be a week away from locking up a Playoff Bye.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>RTRO (1-9) vs Scott & James (7-3):</h3> TPC has been wobbly as of late. RTRO has Aaron Jones on bye and will hope to have another 130+ points-scored-against as it inches one week closer to the all-time most points-against in a season. Scott & James need this win so badly for their Playoff Bye aspirations. It's tough to conceive of right now, but TPC still hasn't ensured a Playoff qualification ..</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Kfish (4-6) vs Joseph & Mike (6-4):</h3> Aaron Rodgers, Chris Carson, and Golden Tate are all on bye at the worst possible time for the Kmish franchise. Likely needing to finish the season 3-0 to make the Playoffs, it's going to take a dud from Joseph & Mike to bring a Kmish win into play this week. Having said that, there's a scenario where JimmyG, Kamara, and Keenan Allen carry the load in a surprise scoring week for Kmish. TBH could open up its FHLC lead with a result this week (1 or 3 Points)</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Crockett (5-5) vs Doug (3-7):</h3> The Crockett franchise has BOTH the fewest points-scored AND the fewest FHLC Points in the league this season. Yet it finds itself in the thick of the Playoff race with a 5-5 record. The numbers clearly show how atrocious this roster has been and still is. With Saquon on bye this week, you'd think the Gray franchise would be in trouble. Instead, its streak of immaculate luck continues as it faces a hapless Doug franchise. Doug is fighting to avoid being a bottom two Consolation Ladder seed.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Gaudet & Cameron (5-5) vs Kyle (6-4):</h3> Could this be the pivotal week DTTW steps into its first Playoffs? No notable players on bye for either team, and ZJs have been underestimated all season. Starting Nick Foles over Kyler Murray is interesting, but the Christian Kirk start last week proved prescient by Gaudet & Cameron. Kyle needs more booms from Watson, Bell, and Jarvis.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h3>Blake (6-4) vs Mitch (5-5):</h3> Here's our annual Tellarico Showdown. Both franchises are 5 Points off the top of the Table, so 3 Points from either/both would have large FHLC implications. 5-win Mitch needs the head-to-head win more than 6-win Blake, obviously, but it feels like both of these franchises should end up in the Playoffs regardless of outcome here. Again, the FHLC is the story in this matchup.</p>
