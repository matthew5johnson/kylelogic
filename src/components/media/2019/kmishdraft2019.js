                        <br></br>
<p>
As the leaves change and now-active school zones double my daily commute time, it’s as good a time as
any to issue my annual KOMMISH DRAFT GRADES. Unfortunately for me, I know these are taken about
as seriously as a summer reading assignment. Nonetheless, like all the brave teachers before me this
time of year, I will toil away in assigning each of you a big fat letter so you know what you’re worth. It’s
the least I can do after the long summer vacation. So sit up straight and sharpen those pencils: class is in
session.

<h3>TEACHER’S PETS</h3>
<br></br>
<h4>THE FIGHTING BUTLERS:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Mr. Big Chest, David Njoku
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): T.Y. Hilton, Devin Singletary
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
The Butlers spent all of 6+ minutes deciding what to do with their 2nd rounder, but ultimately made the
unquestionably correct decision snagging Antonio Brown. Honestly whichever team got him to pair with
their top RB would be head of the class, so there shouldn’t be much surprise here. Truth be told I don’t
hate any of their picks, but formatting requires me to. I’d much rather have Boyd or Golladay than
Hilton, and they both were selected right after TY. I know Bills camp is head over heels for Singletary,
but Frank Gore is still immortal and TJ Yeldon is also a person. Still, this is a very well rounded draft with
not much to be desired.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: A-</h5>

<br></br>
<h4>NICK & DICKEY:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Nick Chubb, Cooper Kupp
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Sammy Watkins, Keke Coutee
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
By the looks of it, these two just went straight up BPA for the majority of the draft. It seems to have paid
off nicely. Chubb is a hell of a get in the middle of the 2 nd . I would have absolutely taken him over guys
like Mixon or Gurley. I was extremely high on Kupp as well, only passing on him in the fifth round myself
since I already had a piece of that WR core in Robert Woods. Like the Butlers I’m struggling to find much
to complain about here, but let’s give it an honest go. Both Watkins and Coutee are fixing to find
themselves Wally Pipp’d by the likes of Mecole Hardman and Kenny Stills respectively. But even if these
two bust, Nick & Mickey will be more than fine.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: A-</h5>

<br></br>
<h4>RTRO:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Sony Michel, Matt Breida
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Chris Godwin, Curtis Samuel
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
RTRO’s draft is a little more flawed than the other two, plus they also gave away about half their yearly
FAAB budget on unnecessary trade-ups (I was never taking Aaron Jones). With that said it’s hard to hate
on a squad sporting both Julio and Odell at WR. Those two are rounded out by high ceiling RBs like
Michel and Breida in the middle rounds. It’s a pretty standard draft formula for RTRO, but why change
what’s been working for a while now. I’m less enthused about unproven WRs like Godwin and Samuel,
but their services probably won’t be needed much with the other WRs on the roster.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: B+</h5>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>TEACHER’S PETS</h3>
<br></br>
<h4>BLAKE:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Tyreek Hill, Leonard Fournette
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Baker Mayfield, N’Keal Harry
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Blake checks in at #4 in the class, mostly being carried on the legs of one Tyreek Hill. I’m still at a loss as
to how he fell so far (though to be fair to Mitch, I do still like Mike Evans more anyway). I also never
thought I’d see the day where LF7 went lower than his ADP in a league full of homers like ours. Even if
he only plays 12 games this year, it’s a steal for Blake. I certainly do not identify as a Baker hater, but
taking him over someone like Rodgers after 13 career games is a bit of a stretch. Also, N’Keal Harry was
already IR’d at the time of our draft. With that said, I do think Blake had one of the better drafts and will
make his first playoff appearance if either Montgomery or Mack emerge as weekly starters.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: B</h5>

<br></br>
<h4>OLD GREGG & MIKE:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Dalvin Cook, Tevin Coleman
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): OJ Howard, Philip Rivers
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Not great but pretty good. These two play it safe, and I feel like I’ve had them ranked post-draft around
this range every year since they joined. I also feel like they’ve had Tevin Coleman and Matt Ryan every
year too. I do like Brieda slightly better given than Coleman given their ADPs, but it’s hard to argue with
Coleman in a familiar offensive system in the 6th round. Dalvin Cook will also be a lock as a top-ten RB if
he stays healthy. On the other side, I’m just not seeing the Howard hype coming to fruition. Cameron
Brate still exists after all, and I don’t buy into the idea that Howard’s targets will magically increase now
that some of last years have been vacated by departing players. Rivers is also a waste of space with Ryan
rostered and plenty other great QBs still on waivers.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: B-</h5>

<br></br>
<h4>MITCH:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Mike Evans, James Washington
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Will Fuller, Pat Mahomes
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Mitch rounds out the students qualifying for the Honor Roll, despite my disagreements with two of his
top five picks. I just cannot justify taking a guy like Fuller given the injury history; it’s just too much to
cover in this limited space. Buying in on Mahomes in the third assumes he duplicates last year’s
legendary performance. Unless he’s in a tier of his own among QBs again, it won’t be worth it. On the
flip side I absolutely love the Mike Evans pick. I was tempted to trade up in the 2nd for a shot at him, but
just couldn’t get it done. He’s my dark horse to finish as the overall WR1 this year in the Arians offense.
James Washington is a mega steal down in the 8th . Big Ben was already building chemistry with him
toward the end of last year, and he should be 2 nd in targets in that offense.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: B-</h5>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>SEE ME AFTER CLASS</h3>
<br></br>
<h4>KYLE:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Jarvis Landry, Austin Ekeler
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Joe Mixon, Drew Brees
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Kyle did his best work toward the middle of the draft, which is impressive considering he’s usually a
drooling drunken mess an hour in. Landry is a hell of a get in the back end of the fifth. Us LSU fans know
all too well that Odell’s presence should only help with his numbers. The Ekeler pick just looks better
and better day by day as it becomes abundantly obvious that Melvin Gordon will not be suiting up for
the Chargers this year. I’m less excited about Mixon considering that the superior Chubb went after him, and the
Bengals just doled out an overly generous new deal to backup Gio Bernard. And please don’t revoke my
Saints fan card, but it makes no sense to take a 2nd QB in the 8th round when your already spent a
premium on your 1st QB in the 4th. I guess that’s why they call it #kylelogic.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: C+</h5>

<br></br>
<h4>NOOBS:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Can’t Guard Mike, Zach Ertz
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Rashaad Penny, Kareem Hunt
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
The Noobs draft is completely defined by their trade up from last to first pick in the 3rd . I love the
aggressive to move go up and get Ertz after Kittle flew off the board earlier than expected. However
they did pay a big price in doing so; their 4th best player is Alshon Jeffery. Their draft strategy really looks
a hell of a lot like RTRO’s: Two stud WRs early followed by a host of RBs in the middle rounds. The
problem is a lot of these RBs don’t fit the profile of an emerging sleeper. Lindsay should be a safe pick
given his performance last year, but I get the sense Royce Freeman will eat into his role this year. Cohen
is not a player I’d feel confident starting week to week. Guys like Penny are useless barring injury, an
absolute reach when other handcuffs went much later or remain on waivers. Keeping Kareem Hunt all
year means essentially crippling yourself with six bench spots for most of the season for very little
payoff.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: C</h5>

<br></br>
<h4>ZJs:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Travis Kelce, James White
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Christian Kirk, Kyler Murray
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Given the early selections of Kittle and Ertz, getting Kelce just a few spots earlier is a hell of a deal. James
White continues to be hilariously underrated despite doing nothing but produce in a great offense year
after year. Brady has complete trust in the guy, no question. I think it’s just the generic name that drives
down his value. After that though, I don’t see a whole lot to get excited about. I think the
Kingsbury/Murray experiment will be an unmitigated disaster. I also do not understand why they’d
waste a pick on Murray when Big Ben was taken with their following pick anyway. I’m also not
particularly high on guys like Westbrook, and AJ Green could turn out to be a wash as an injured, aging
vet on a tanking franchise.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: C-</h5>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>PUT ON YOUR DUNCE HAT AND SIT IN THE CORNER</h3>
<br></br>
<h4>B2B LEAGUE CHAMP:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): George Kittle, Emmanuel Sanders
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Damien Williams, Larry Fitzgerald
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
Doug has earned the benefit of the doubt here so I’ll start with the good. Kittle was a very savvy pick in
the 2nd considering there was zero chance he’d make it around to Doug’s 3rd rounder. The Champ
recognized that Crockett or I were dead set on snagging him at the turn if given the opportunity.
Sanders was someone that I had listed in all caps on my board as a must have. He could easily return
high end WR2 value; a great get for an 8th rounder. But it gets very bad starting with the Damien pick
though, especially when you consider the McCoy signing was already known by everyone at that point.
Doug’s beach tan turned to a ghastly pale-white when I informed him after the draft that McCoy was
getting more guaranteed money than Damien got in the offseason. Aside from Zeke, his only other RBs
are Guice, and some now-worthless handcuffs. If Guice has to miss any time later in the season, Doug
will be up shit’s creek without a paddle. His starting WRs are Lockett and Fitzgerald. It will take another
year of superb in-season management if Doug wants a shot at the three-peat.
</p>
<h5>FINAL GRADE: D+</h5>

<br></br>
<h4>GREY DICK:</h4>
<p>
Best Pick(s): Saquon Barkley, Devonta Freeman
</p>
<p>
Worst Pick(s): Melvin Gordon, Josh Allen
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
At least he didn’t pass on Saquon. As I did my mocks over the past few weeks I couldn’t believe it when
the ADPs got shuffled around and Saquon found himself below Kamara or McCaffery. It shouldn’t even
be a question; I’ve never seen a back like him in my life. Freeman will also be a locked in top 10 RB if he
can stay upright most of the season. It gets awfully ugly after that however. Crockett loves to talk about
sunk cost fallacy. If he’s true to his word he should drop Melvin Gordon tomorrow. If not he can enjoy
playing with six bench spots the whole year. He went exclusively WR after this, and could find some
weekly starters there. But they certainly won’t be difference makers to put him over the top. Couple
that with weak TEs, QB and zero RB depth, and it’s easy to slot this draft as dead last. I’m afraid I’m
going to have to ask your parents for you to repeat the 4th grade.
