                        <h1>2019 Strength of Schedules</h1>
<p>Before we get started, a quick reminder on how the schedules work: There are 13 regular season weeks. Everyone plays 9 teams once and 2 teams twice. Of the 2 teams that you play twice, one is your rival while the other is a different team each season.  
<br></br>
<br></br>
*Rivalry Weeks: Weeks 5 & 13
<br></br>
*Double opponents: Weeks 1 & 12
<br></br>
<br></br>
STRENGTH OF SCHEDULE: Most difficult is #1, Easiest is #12

<p>
The strength of schedule coefficient (SoS Coefficient) is based on opponents’ average points-per-game. A higher SoS coeff means a more difficult schedule. Since it’s so heavily reliant upon PPG, franchises that are traditional low scorers will have a slightly inflated SoS coeff while the opposite will be true of traditional high scorers. This means that Doug, the #3 highest scoring franchise in the league, must have an especially brutal schedule this season.
</p>
<p>
Right off the bat, the first thing that we notice is that the Kyle franchise has by far the most difficult schedule of 2019. Finding itself up against Kfish in the Double and RTRO as the annual rival, the Kyle franchise has a serious uphill battle to qualify for its first playoff appearance in 10 years.  Blake will also have a very difficult time trying to make his franchise’s first ever playoff appearance going up against the #2 most difficult schedule, seeing a traditional powerhouse rotate in as his Double this season. 
</p>
<p>
Nick & Mickey, Kfish, and Crockett all have favorable schedules, which will help in their ’19 campaigns as they all continue to knock on the door of securing a first league title.
</p>
<p>
The Matt & Ross and Scott & James franchises both have absolutely golden opportunities this season with complete green-light schedules. It’s hilarious that the Crockett franchise shows up on both of them. Matt & Ross are looking to regain the magic of old and couldn’t ask for anything more than getting the #12 scoring franchise (109 PPG) in the Double. Scott & James had separated themselves as a top-half franchise during the first three seasons of the Modern Era and even logged a 2016 championship appearance. Yet they let it all go last season in spectacular fashion as they lost the Sacko to their rival, Blake. This season is their opportunity to right the ship.
</p>
<p>
RTRO’s lowest SoS coeff is due in large part to having the highest PPG and not having to play themselves.
</p>

<h3>Most exciting Doubles of 2019: </h3>
<h4>1. Doug vs RTRO</h4>
<p>
If this were the NFL, the Doug vs RTRO matchup would get a primetime Sunday Night slot in week 1 and a primetime Monday Night slot in week 12. The Doug franchise is coming off of its second consecutive league championship and has three championship game appearances in the last four seasons. RTRO is two years removed from back-to-back-to-back championship game appearances with consecutive league championships to show for it. During the Modern Era, the Doug franchise has averaged 128.4 PPG and RTRO has averaged 125.2 PPG, numbers that emphatically pace the rest of the competition. RTRO and Doug have surged ahead and become two goliaths of our league. This is the perfect time for the scheduling stars to align, giving The Crew a week 1 and week 12 matchup between these two titanic programs.
</p>
<h4>2. Nick & Mickey vs Mitch</h4>
<p>
At #6 (Nick & Mickey) and #8 (Mitch), these two franchises find themselves in the middle of the pack when it comes to overall strength of schedule in 2019. That means that schedule shouldn’t be an outsized hindrance in their potential playoff qualification bids. This specific Double is intriguing because each franchise has been putting up consistently good seasons throughout the Modern Era, both seemingly on the cusp of grabbing a title. Although the Mitch franchise has endured some dark years following its 2011 league championship, it’s coming off of three consecutive playoff appearances. Meanwhile, the Nick & Mickey franchise has already established itself as a perennial power, posting top-4 PPG during the Modern Era and completing two top-4 overall finishes in just its first few years of existence. The sky is the limit for this burgeoning franchise. Whoever can control this Double should have the inside track to a high playoff seed.
</p>
<h4>3. Kyle vs Kfish</h4>
<p>
With by far the most difficult schedule of 2019, the Kyle franchise will need to figure out a way to at least come away 1-1 from this brutal Double against Kmish. 4 of Kyle’s 13 games this season are against Kmish and RTRO. It’ll take a different tact than in years past if this season is to be the turnaround of DTTW. According to GroupMe developments, it sounds like Pwns will be attending this weekend's draft. There were even hints that Pwns could rejoin the front office of the Kyle franchise in 2019, however these reports are unconfirmed. Stay tuned for more on this developing situation. On the other side, Kmish needs to take full advantage of this Double since he’s got his hands completely full in two rivalry matchups against the mighty Doug franchise. Securing a sweep of the Double would put the Kmish franchise in solid position to yet again make the playoffs, especially considering the middle-of-the-pack strength of schedule. 
</p>
<h4>Dark horse for exciting Double:
    <br></br> 
Joseph & Mike vs Gaudet & Cameron
</h4>
<p>
With the ZJs trending downward and the Joseph & Mike franchise on the upswing, this could be a sneaky fun double in 2019. Joseph & Mike are fresh off a championship game appearance while Gaudet & Cameron are reeling after barely escaping the fate of consecutive Sackos. If Joseph & Mike can continue to dominate their rivalry series, this season could yet again hold a lot of promise for TBH.
</p>
<br></br>

<h3>Most anticipated rivalries of 2019:</h3>
<h4>1. Matt & Ross vs Crockett</h4>
<p>
    When it comes to rivalries, this one is the default answer. These two franchises have played each other the most times in league history and have traded success back and forth over the years. Similar to Gaudet & Cameron, however, the Matt & Ross franchise has currently found itself fallen on hard times while the Crockett franchise is the model of consistency. The Butlers have been able to salvage the past two seasons by winning back-to-back consolation brackets, which from now on will be a big deal since it earns qualification to the next season’s Maze’s Width Marathon Stage. But they’ve had to endure allowing the Crockett franchise qualify for the playoffs during every single year of the Modern Era. In the ultimate power move, Crockett decided to play his matchups in the playoffs by throwing his #RivalryWeek13 game. Predictably, Crockett blew the shrewd week 13 decision by becoming the first team in history to lose a playoff game against an opponent who scored less than 100 points, and ultimately going on to lose in the 3rd place game. The two rivalry weeks each season are a significant chunk of the schedule, so whoever controls their rivalry matchup can heavily impact their odds of making the postseason. It always feels like a contender emerges out of this rivalry.
</p>
<h4>2. Kfish vs Doug</h4>
<p>
It’s true that the Matt & Ross vs Crockett rivalry has significant historical significance when compared to the Kfish vs Doug rivalry, however this rivalry has undoubtedly turned into the rivalry of the Modern Era. Epic margins of victory, ruthless trash talk, and massive postseason implications are what we’ve come to expect from this clash every week 5 and 13. Unsurprisingly, this rivalry has produced a top 4 team in all four years of the Modern Era, and each franchise has only missed the playoffs once during that time frame. The last time the Kmish franchise beat Doug was in #RivalryWeek13 of 2017, but the series remains tight with the Doug franchise maintaining a 6-4 record.
</p>
<h4>3. Blake vs Scott & James</h4>
<p>
This might be the most interesting rivalry of 2019, given what went down last season. We were treated to our first ever rivalry showdown in a Sacko last season between these two, and it didn’t disappoint. At 163.8 – 137.5, it was the highest scoring Sacko ever at 301.3 total points (topping the Kyle vs Mitch Sacko last season at 243 total points). It also resulted in the Blake franchise winning ALL THREE of its 2018 rivalry matchups (!!). Blake advanced to 5-2 all-time in the rivalry. Could this be the season that Blake seizes this advantageous rivalry matchup to make his first playoff push in franchise history? Or could it be the year that The Peoples’ Choice finds themselves in the playoffs again and gets back on track?
