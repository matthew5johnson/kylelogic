                        <h1>Week 3</h1>
                        <h3>The week of Scott & James</h3>
<br></br>
<p>The Scott & James franchise finds itself sitting atop the Playoff Championship standings this week. For some reason, it feels special. Guess how many times the Scott & James franchise has EVER found itself in that position. Really, think about it. This franchise has been around since before the Expansion Era, playing games since at least 2010. Recorded history only goes back to the start of 2011. That means this week marked the 110th regular season game played by The Peoples' Choice.</p>
<p>If you guessed that TPC has been #1 in the Playoff standings about one week per season, or about 8-10 times, you guessed well. The league average for total number of weeks in first place is just over 9, with the median a bit below that. It makes sense since you figure the Noobs have at least been good enough to land in first place a minimum of one week in each of their 9 admittedly lackluster seasons.</p>
<p>You guessed well, but not well enough. Coming into week 2 of 2019 ... get this ... the Scott & James franchise had only sat atop the Playoff standings for a total of two weeks in history. Wait - it gets better. Before this week, the last time TPC sat at #1 was 2,894 days ago!!! Week 6 and 1 of 2011 are the only two other weeks Scott & James have been atop the Playoff standings.</p>
<p>For some perspective on just how silly this is, understand that the Doug franchise was 1st place for all 13 weeks during its historic wire-to-wire Playoff Championship run in 2017. RTRO was 1st place in 11 of the 13 weeks during its 2015 Playoff Championship. RTRO also leads the league in total weeks in first place, with 26. Joseph & Mike are second with a surprising 22 weeks in first place, and the Matt & Ross franchise rounds out the top-3 with 18. Even the Kyle franchise has been first place in 5 weeks throughout its history, although none of those weeks have come in the second half of a season.</p>
<p>So yes, it turns out there's a reason this week felt special afterall. Celebrate this accomplishment, Noobs, because you've got a brutal week 3 matchup against the Nick & Mickey powerhouse.</p>
<br></br>
<p>On top of their historic weekend, TPC also makes headlines this week with a blockbuster trade. Scott & James traded Lamar Jackson (QB) to Blake for Marlon Mack (RB).</p>
<br></br>
<p>This move has the potential to shift powers in the league. By trading what they viewed as their backup QB, TPC clearly gets a massive upgrade on what has already performed as an elite roster. They were in dire need to running back help, and they got it. This move has to solidify them as an early-season candidate to lock up a Playoff BYE for the first time in franchise history.</p>
<p>It's possible that the bigger story is on the other side of the deal, however. Blake caught some flak in GroupMe from our resident zero-time-champion and perpetual-playoff-choker, the Gray franchise, which is usually a good sign that you're headed in exactly the right direction. Yes, Blake's 0-2 start means that he's begun 0-2 in each of his four seasons, but now he's getting more proactive in molding his roster. Since joining the league in 2016, the Blake franchise has been among the least active franchises in trades and free agency, recording only 10 moves in '16 (second to last in the league), 12 moves in '17 (third to last in the league), and 7 moves last season (last in the league). The final rankings have been correspondingly lacking as this franchise is yet to finish better than #8.</p>
<p>For the sake of the Blake franchise, hopefully this blockbuster trade portends a trend toward more roster activity in the future which will only improve odds of success. To be fair, the Blake franchise has continually become more assertive with roster moves as it's gotten its footing, most notably starting with the trade of Julio for Tyreek in week 7 of 2017. Blake cited Julio's inconsistency as the primary reason for the move. Consensus at the time, just as it is with this week's trade, was that the Blake franchise had lost the deal. However, being in the consensus isn't the path to dominance, and time would reveal the logic behind Blake's move to be extremely sound. Tyreek would go on to score 153 points for Blake that season while Julio would score nearly the exact same amount for Doug. But Blake's call of Julio being too boom-bust couldn't have been more accurate. The prescience is uncanny: Julio went on to post 3 weeks below 10 points and 3 weeks above 20 after the trade. Tyreek Hill posted 0 weeks below 10 and 2 weeks above 20.</p>
<p>These sorts of gut feelings and non-consensus predictions are the hardest to make, because the external echo chamber is totally against them. It's exactly these moves that can set you completely apart in fantasy. Will these experiences grow this franchise's confidence enough to start becoming more active in trades and free agency? Lamar may very well usher in a new era for the Blake franchise in multiple respects.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<h3>Major Competitions</h3>
<p>We'll be following our four Major Competitions each week. The variety of competitions and novelty therein can be confusing at first, but by reading about them and competing in them they'll quickly become second nature to everyone. It won't be any different than how you think about our playoffs and #RivalryWeeks.</p>
<p>Plus, the new features added to the @bot will make it easy to casually keep up with everything. Relevant @bot commands will be mentioned in these articles.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The best way of visualizing the four competitions is by visiting the <a href="/competitions">competitions</a> page on a non-mobile device. We have a Playoff Championship <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i>, Marathon <i id="icons" class="fas fa-award"></i>, League Cup <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i>, and a Community Shield <i id="icons" class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>.</p>
<p>'@bot commands' or '@bot help' will always give you a list of commands and competitions if you forget something.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Now every franchise can choose which competition to prioritize. Given the disparate nature of each competition, winning a Double, Treble, or even Quad all seem like low-likelihood propositions. Early signs point to Mitch aiming at a League Cup, Kyle jostling for MWM Stage qualification, and Doug going after another Playoff Championship. Let's see which direction everyone else decides to go.</p>

            <p>We've already hit on the headline story as it pertains to the Playoff Championship standings. The Scott & James franchise only landed atop the standings by edging out Doug by 0.3 points, so it'll take some serious effort to stay there for another week.</p> 
            <p>The Butlers' fast start with 190+ points in week 1 earns them the points-scored tiebreaker over the other five 1-1 franchises. Week 3 isn't a time to panic over Playoff standings. Everybody is still in the hunt for a Playoff BYE (top 2 seeds) and Playoff qualification (top 6).</p>

        <h5>Quick summary: each week the top-4 scorers get 3 League Cup Points, middle-4 get 1 Point, bottom-4 get 0. The franchise at the top of the League Cup Table at the end of week 13 will hoist the FHLC.</h5>
        <p>Scott & James sit atop the Finch Howe League Cup Table this week with 4 League Cup Points. Early rumors out of the Mitch franchise are that it loves the new FHLC, and is prioritizing this competition. Alas, there it sits in the very thick of things with 4 Points. Lurking with 3 League Cup Points are contenders like Matt & Ross, Kyle, and Nick & Mickey. Despite its 0-2 start and bottom-3 status in the Playoff Championship Standings, the Blake franchise is actually sitting pretty in the League Cup Table with 2 Points. Now it adds what could be a 3-Point-machine in Lamar Jackson. This is the beauty of the FHLC competition - if you score well but get unlucky with your weekly head-to-head matchup, you're still rewarded with League Cup Points. The Tellarico bros might try to corner the Cup.</p>
        <p>But most concerning are the bottom three teams in the Table since it's tough to see direct path to three points for any of them this week. The Kmish and Crockett franchises really need to avoid another 0 Point week. ZJ's roster doesn't appear to be equipped with the necessary assets to hope for anything more than 1 Point this week. It already needs AJ Green to return in the worst way.</p>

        <p>Looking back on the Modern Era, a different franchise would have won the Playoff Championship and League Cup in every season except for one.</p>
        <p>We've already got Scott & James and Doug at the top of the Standings and Table, respectively. If one of them pulls off the impressive Double, the Community Shield would have to take the runner-up to the League Cup.</p>
        <p>The Shield gives the league a meaningful game prior to #RivalryWeek and adds an even larger reward to the participants. The two qualifiers will each have won a Major Competition of their own in the prior season. This game is sort of like the ultimate championship game since the participants will have gone through the League Cup Table and the MWM qualification and Stage victory just to reach this game.</p>

        <p>Background: A "Super Cup" is a competition in European soccer which often forms the "curtain-raiser" to a season. It is typically contested by two competition winners of the previous season: the knock-out cup winner and the league winner.</p>
        <p>In English soccer, the FA Community Shield is a Super Cup between the EPL Table winner (which would be the Finch Howe League Cup champion for us) and the FA Cup (which would be the MWM Stage winner for us).</p>
        <p>The wording can get really dicey, so don't worry about all of that if it's confusing. Just win this year's Playoff Championship or Finch Howe League Cup to gain entry into the 2020 Community Shield.</p>

<h2>Week 2 Storylines</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>The Joseph & Mike franchise is now 1-1 for the first time ever. They've started 2-0 three times and 0-2 once. Additionally of note: there have only been six 4-0 starts in history. Two of those six are by TBH. Can they make it three?</p></li>
    <li><p>ZJs have now started 0-2 in a league-worst 6 different seasons.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Kyle franchise has started 1-0 in five straight seasons. The Kyle franchise has also started 1-1 in five straight seasons. That's a 5-year week 2 losing streak. DTTW's 2-6 record in week 3s doesn't bode well either, although matching up against the Gray franchise can't hurt.</p></li>
    <li><p>Only 3 times have we ever seen a team start three WRs who all scored 25+ points. Matt & Ross did in in 2013 with Nuk, Kenny Stills, and Keenan Allen. Crockett did it in 2016 with Mike Evans, Randall Cobb, and Julio. And RTRO did it this week with Julio, Chris Godwin, and Odell.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Butlers set a new points-scored franchise record in week 1, but had a disappointing sub-100 week 2. You would never guess that it was their 36th sub-100 showing, good for 3rd worst in the league (ZJs 41, Kyle 40).</p></li>
    <li><p>Joseph & Mike's fantasy defense is back to being elite. 198.9 points-against is third best in the league. Despite their consistent head-to-head luck/wins, the FHLC Table will expose their usual low/moderate weekly scoring.</p></li>
    <li><p>With 180.9 points over the first two weeks, the Gaudet & Cameron franchise is off to the fourth worst two-week start in history. #RIPGarner&Doyle hold the record(?) with 153.0 points through weeks 1 & 2 in 2015.</p></li>
    <li><p>It's a small sample size, but the Rams D/ST has compiled the best two week start in Nick & Mickey franchise history (16 points which beats 15 in 2017)</p></li>
    <li><p>Kfish has faced an insane slate of opponent scores for 8 consecutive weeks, dating back to last season. 225, 121, 114, 130, 173, 131, 174, and 134. Add to that the fact that he's got Doug slotted into both #RivalryWeeks. Godspeed sir.</p></li>
    <li><p>It doesn't help that the Kmish franchise posted its 6th worst performance in franchise history last week.</p></li>
    <li><p>Surely Mahomes' 42.9 this week would land in the Mitch franchise's top-3 QB performances, right? Wrong. This franchise has quite the QB pedigree that also happens to be shockingly diverse. Names ahead of Mahomes include Derek Carr, Tom Brady (twice), Andrew Luck, and Philip Rivers.</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 3 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<h5 class="center">#2 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Doug | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #2</h5>
<h5 class="center">- vs -</h5>
<h5 class="center">#10 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Blake | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #9</h5>
<p>The projections look real bad for the Blake franchise. With an 18 point projected loss and all but one positional advantage belonging to Doug, it's going to be up to newly acquired Lamar to slay Goliath this week. Even if Damien Williams sits, Dak and Zeke are playing the Phins while Kittle is back at home against the Steelers. The Doug franchise is ready to rock in week 3. Can it start 3-0 for a second time in franchise history? (3-0 in 2017). This is the perfect spot where Blake can sort of ignore the tough matchup vs Doug and focus on getting 1 League Cup Point. That would keep him squarely in the middle of the FHLC Table and let him live to fight another day.</p>   
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h5 class="center">#6 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Mitch | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #3</h5>
<h5 class="center">- vs -</h5>
<h5 class="center">#3 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Joseph & Mike | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #4</h5>
<p>In their last 10 games dating back to last year, the Joseph & Mike franchise is 0-4 against opponents who score more than 100 points, and 6-0 against opponents scoring less than 100 (6 OF THEIR LAST 10 GAMES AGAINST SUB-100 OPPONENTS!). Is this our craziest stat of the week? Whatever it is, it's simply unsustainable. Mahomes in a shootout against Baltimore this week almost guarantees that the Mitch franchise will score 100+. TBH's kryptonite.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h5 class="center">#4 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Matt & Ross | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #5</h5>
<h5 class="center">- vs -</h5>
<h5 class="center">#12 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Gaudet & Cameron | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #12</h5>
<p>The Butlers fell back into the sub-100 doldrums after registering a franchise record in week 1. They couldn't have hoped for a better matchup this week to get back on track. The ZJs are the only franchise that has yet to score a League Cup Point, so it stands to reason that a Butlers have a great chance of notching the win if they can secure even 1 League Cup Point with just a middle-of-the-pack score. The Gaudet & Cameron franchise has scored above the league scoring average in 2 of its last 14 games.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h5 class="center">#5 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Kyle | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #6</h5>
<h5 class="center">- vs -</h5>
<h5 class="center">#8 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Crockett | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #11</h5>
<p>This matchup is interesting because it has a chance to influence the direction each of these franchise's season will go. Crockett's still has every question mark that it started with - is Josh Allen good? What if Devonta Freeman doesn't have the O-line to produce this year? Are the correct 3 WR shots in the dark being started? Do we get week 1 Hockenson or week 2 Hockenson?</p>
<p>The engine for Kyle is Deshaun Watson and the RB corps. He'll live and die with LeVeon, Mixon, and Ekeler.</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h5 class="center">#7 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Nick & Mickey | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #7</h5>
<h5 class="center">- vs -</h5>
<h5 class="center">#1 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Scott & James | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #1</h5>
<p>These are two of the best rosters in the league at the moment. As you might have heard, TPC is rolling. When they return to reality, though, they'll have to deal with both ace WRs now missing their starting QBs. Brady is going to crush the Jets and Ertz is going to be a target funnel with the rest of that offense hurt.</p>
<p>Nick & Mickey have some inopportune individual matchups this week, but if Chubb can survive the Rams, Kerryon can get past the Philly front 7, and the Davante Adams + Sammy Watkins combo can get open against Denver and Baltimore, they could give TPC its first real challenge of the season (TPC has yet to face an opponent scoring 100+)</p>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<h5 class="center">#11 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | Kmish | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #10</h5>
<h5 class="center">- vs -</h5>
<h5 class="center">#9 <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i> | RTRO | <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i> #8</h5>
<p>The Kmish franchise's week 1 performance was good enough to earn 1 League Cup Point despite the unlucky loss (facing 170+ points-against), but opening the season 0-2 against a slate of Kyle and Scott & James isn't ideal. Kmish started last season 1-4 and still qualified for the Playoffs. There shouldn't be any panic here. The roster is looking solid after splashing 50+ FAAB on Demarcus Robinson, and it's only a matter of time until Aaron Rodgers figures out his new offense. Hopefully losing Brees doesn't impact Kamara too much.</p>
<br></br>

<p>Big football weekend. Enjoy</p>
