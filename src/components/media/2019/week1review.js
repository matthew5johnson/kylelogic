<h3>Finch Howe League Cup</h3>

<p>We'll be taking a look at the League Cup standings every Wednesday.</p>
<p>League Cup mechanics are extremely simple: the top 4 scoring teams each week get 3 points, the middle 4 scoring teams get 1 point, and the bottom 4 teams get 0 points. The franchise with the most League Cup points at the end of our 13 game regular season wins the League Cup trophy.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Why the namesake? While running the numbers from past seasons to see how previous League Cups would have played out, I discovered that the Joseph & Mike franchise would have won it in 2016 ... the year they joined the league. That means Joseph & Mike are the first of the new Modern Era franchises to (theoretically) win hardware. Thus, it's only right that we honor the would-be original holders of the League Cup trophy. #CrossFinch</p>
<br></br>
<h4>FHLC Historical Context</h4>
<p>The Finch Howe League Cup is interesting for a few reasons. First, it eliminates most of the luck aspect that comes along with our head-to-head format. If a franchise scores in the top third of the league in any given week, they've earned the full 3 League Cup points regardless of opponent.</p>
<p>Second, the eventual League Champion wouldn't have won the League Cup in any of the past 3 seasons. That's a clear indication that the League Cup and League Playoffs are distinctly different competitions, making winning both pieces of hardware a super impressive feat.</p>
<p>Third, the past four League Cup winners would have scored 25, 27, 27, and 32 League Cup points. There are a few different avenues to hoisting a Cup ... a boom-bust strategy, a low-ceiling consistent strategy, or an even-distribution strategy. This adds yet another layer of intrigue on top of our traditional league structure</p>
<p>And finally, the vision is to eventually establish a Krewe Community Shield game between the Finch Howe League Cup winner and the Maze's Width Marathon Stage winner. The first Community Shield will take place in the 2021 season.</p>
<br></br>
<p>This completes the process of establishing our four major competitions. We now have:
    <ol>
        <li>Our traditional League Champion determined by the playoffs</li>
        <li>A League Cup trophy determined by the season-long Finch Howe League Cup table</li>
        <li>Maze's Width Marathon as our Champions League analog</li>
        <li>The annual Community Shield game pairing our League Cup winner with the MWM Stage winner</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>Week 1 Review</h3>
<br></br>
<h4>147.5 – 98</h4>
<h5>Mitch defeats Nick & Mickey</h5>
<p>Mitch put up the 14th highest score in modern franchise history while Nick & Mickey scored the 9th lowest of their franchise history. The story here is that Mahomes, Engram, David Johnson, and Mark Ingram carried Mitch to victory. Could Tyrell Williams and Mark Andrews both be relevant coming off of the bench for the Mitch franchise?</p>
<p>On the other side, the Nick & Mickey franchise is off to an 0-1 start for the first time since 2016 in large part due to a brutal week from everyone except Josh Jacobs. Chubb and Kerryon, the team’s namesakes, were downright abominable while Davante Adams, Kupp, and Vance McDonald did nothing to rectify the situation. The bench is showing promise, however, as surely Sammy Watkins and Hollywood Brown can find their way into the starting lineup for week 2.</p>

<br></br>
<h4>134.1 – 92.5</h4>
<h5>Scott & James defeat Crockett</h5>
<p>It’s going to be a fun week when Lamar Jackson goes for 42 and you get double digit points from every other offensive starter in the lineup. Scott & James have the luxury of relying on JuJu and @Can’tGuardMike while deciding between Lamar and Tom Brady at QB. The thin bench is a concern, but this franchise should take a few days to enjoy only its THIRD opening day win EVER (opening day wins in ‘11, ‘17, and ’19).</p>
<p>It was the 11th worst performance by the Crockett franchise in the Modern Era. The only good to takeaway this week was from the bench. DeSean Jackson did DJax things in another revenge game, and T.J. Hockenson might not be completely worthless as a rookie TE. Meanwhile, the search remains on to find two or three more reliable WRs. The Freeman situation at RB could be a major cause for concern, especially given the frightening lack of depth at that position. It’s already gotten so dire that this franchise is lobbying to change our league settings to accommodate its desire to roster a 9th WR.</p>

<br></br>
<h4>194.6 – 129.5</h4>
<h5>Matt & Ross defeat Blake</h5>
<p>It turns out that TY Hilton and Derrick Henry are alive and well after all. Wentz and CMC put the icing on the cake with their 78 combined points, leading The Butlers to a demolition of their previous all-time franchise scoring record of 186.7 (week 14 of 2013) to lock up this week’s $10 for league-wide high score. It’s astonishing that Matt & Ross had only scored 170+ a single time during the Modern Era prior to this week, so it’s good to see them get back on track.</p>
<p>The Blake franchise got a bit unlucky this week. It put up the #10 best performance in franchise history, yet still got trounced by 60+. This was quietly looking like it might be the year of Blake. Pre-season rhetoric was strong coming out of the Blake franchise's camp, and external media sources were independently verifying the cause for positivity. Nuk and Marlon Mack had stellar performances, but it’s the injury bug that bites Blake for a second consecutive opening weekend – Tyreek Hill is a massive loss. Fournette should also be negatively affected by the installation of Gardner Minshew at QB in Jacksonville. Matt Nagy had a rough game of play-calling on Thursday night, and it’s super unfortunate that David Montgomery is stuck in that system. Courtland Sutton and Ted Ginn were bright spots on the bench though. Time will tell if the Blake franchise is able to manage its way back up to where pre-season expectations were set.</p>

<br></br>
<h4>118.6 – 99.2</h4>
<h5>Joseph & Mike defeat Gaudet & Cameron</h5>
<p>Dalvin Cook and Amari Cooper led the way for The Trading Black Hole, and Matt Ryan salvaged his day in garbage time. Starting the Jags defense against Kansas City was perplexing, but definitely fits the bill for this franchise. We’ll have to see if Gurley’s knees can hold up. Could TBH’s elite fantasy defense of 2018 already be carrying over into 2019?</p>
<p>The ZJs swung for the fences in the draft, but we’ll have to reserve final judgement until we see what this roster looks like with AJ Green back in the mix. Kyler was horrific for 3 quarters, and good for 2 quarters. Gaudet & Cameron will hope for second half Kyler to go along with some better performances from Travis Kelce and James Conner. If you thought Scott & James’ opening day record stat was surprising … listen to this: Gaudet & Cameron have only won a SINGLE opening game in franchise history. That means they’re 1-8 in week 1’s now.</p>

<br></br>
<h4>174.3 – 145</h4>
<h5>Kyle defeats Kfish</h5>
<p>This was the #7 best performance in Kyle franchise history. 2nd best in modern franchise history behind week 1 of 2018 and ahead of week 1 of 2016. In stark contrast to the bad week 1 stats that we’ve already discussed above, the Kyle franchise is far and away the best week 1 performer in our league. This win now makes it seven opening day wins in a row. Deshaun Watson, LeVeon, and Ekeler were all horses who carried the squad, and Jamison Crowder might be a diamond in the rough sitting on the bench. Kyle has lost 4 consecutive week 2 matchups, however, so the real test is upcoming. Could this finally be the year?!</p>
<p>Kfish gets mega unlucky in this spot, putting up the 9th most points in modern franchise history yet still suffering a defeat. But things look verrry promising if Aaron Rodgers can turn things around against non-Bears defenses. Kamara is a stud, Carson and Keenan Allen will have explosive weeks, and this bench is scary deep. I was wondering why I couldn’t find Carlos Hyde on the waiver wire. Kmish is always a safe bet to qualify for the playoffs. This looks like another one of those rosters.</p>

<br></br>
<h4>147.2 – 64.7</h4>
<h5>Doug defeats RTRO</h5>
<p>Dak’s 45.4 point performance was the third best QB performance EVER from the Doug franchise, trailing only two of Mahomes’ games last season. Mahomes was taken in the 11th round of our 2018 draft. Dak was taken in the 11th round of this year’s draft. It sure looks like Doug has found 11th-round QB heaven in consecutive years. Allen Robinson and Emmanuel Sanders also looked good, and Zeke is about to feast on the league again this season.</p>
