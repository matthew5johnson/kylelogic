                        <h1>Week 4</h1>
                        <h3>The month of Scott & James</h3>
<br></br>
<p>Seven days ago we were talking about how special of a start this was for TPC, and went as far as to deem last week "the week of Scott & James". Now here we are after three consecutive incredible games for this franchise staring into the face of even more history.</p>
<p>The Scott & James franchise knocked off Nick & Mickey by 2.4 points in what ended up being the -closest- game in TPC history (the previous closest game in franchise history is their 2.8 point loss to ZJs in wk 13 of '11). TPC's 414 points trails only the start to their 2016 campaign (457 points), and they had never begun a season 3-0 prior to this weekend. They're now atop Playoff Standings for a second consecutive week for the first time ever. It's all going right for the Noobs this month.</p>
<p>Next TPC victim up is the Matt & Ross franchise - and this weekend's games will all still be played in the current month of September. Dare we declare it ... the month of Scott & James? Hype train full steam ahead</p>
<br></br>
<p>Entering this past week there had been a total of 31 games decided by fewer than 3 points since 2011. Furthermore, we had only ever seen two games closer than 3 points in the same week (wk 2 of '16 and wk 10 of '18).</p>
<p>We set a new record with three games decided by less than 3 points. The average margin of victory across the six games this week was 12.0 points. Only week 1 of 2012 was more closely contested, with a 9.2 average margin. Even crazier, there have only been 3 weeks ever that have had an average margin of victory below 13.0. For additional context, the largest weekly margin of victory was 55.0 points, and the average of the entire Modern Era has been 29.8 points. A convincing argument can be made that we just experienced the most intense week in our league's history.</p>
<br></br>
<p>The Butlers endured a SECOND agonizing 0.6 point loss in their franchise history (1st was vs Doug in wk 12 of '15), and it was a game against ZJs they really needed to have. ZJs had a rare 120+ performance that turned into a pivotal win for Gaudet & Cameron here, and crucially also earned them their first League Cup Point in franchise history. Matt & Ross not only lost the head-to-head matchup by 0.6 points, but missed out on 1 League Cup Point by that same margin. You hate to see it. Better luck next week against mighty TPC.</p> 
<p>None of these 3 close matchups was more intriguing than the Blake franchise's epic Monday Night comeback to upset the unsuspecting Doug franchise. The Bears defense basically had to shoulder the load in David Montgomery's stead, needing 20+ to get the victory. And that it did, taking advantage of the hapless Case Keenum. This wild Blake/Doug matchup made for a super fun MNF game of what would otherwise have been unwatchable football.</p>
<p>With the win, Blake now sports a 3-2 record against Doug. Also, Blake moves to 4-11 in pre-#RivalryWeek games. That's the worst mark in the league trailing Matt & Ross and Gaudet & Cameron who both sit at 5-10 over that same time span.</p>
<p>Blake's final tally added up to 129.3 points, which was only the third 120+ effort against Doug since week 9 of last season, and two of those have resulted in a Doug L. Maybe some shades of TBH fantasy defense starting to take shape here?</p>
<p>Let's take a peek at the stats since the start of last season: PPG = Doug (138.0) vs TBH (124.2) | PPG against = Doug (120.4) vs TBH (114.0)</p>
<p>Nope. No shades of skating by on fantasy defense alone. Carry on.</p>

<h3>Major Competitions</h3>
<p>The best way of visualizing the four competitions is by visiting the <a href="/competitions">competitions</a> page on a non-mobile device. We have a Playoff Championship <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i>, Marathon <i id="icons" class="fas fa-award"></i>, League Cup <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i>, and a Community Shield <i id="icons" class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>.</p>

            <p>The Playoff Standings are nearly even after three weeks, with one 3-0 team and no 0-3 teams. Mitch is leads the league in scoring which will win the seeding tie-breaker over all other 2-1 teams.</p>

        <h5>Quick summary: each week the top-4 scorers get 3 League Cup Points, middle-4 get 1 Point, bottom-4 get 0. The franchise at the top of the League Cup Table at the end of week 13 will hoist the FHLC.</h5>
        <p>Scott & James are no longer top of the table, and this is where the beauty of FHLC shines. The #1 highest scoring team beat the #2 highest scoring team this week. And the #3 team beat the #4 team. That makes week 3 the unluckiest possible week for the 3 League Cup Point tier of teams, with the maximum two of them losing. Despite the most unlucky head-to-head matchups, however, Joseph & Mike and Nick & Mickey both lock up a massive 3 League Cup Points. This keeps TBH tied at the top of the table and Nick & Mickey just one Point behind the top 3.</p>
        <p>Kyle was a few fantasy points away from stealing 3 League Cup Points this week, but he'll surely be happy to walk away with both the head-to-head win and the 1 Cup Point this week, maintaining solid middle of the table status. As mentioned earlier, the Blake franchise had an epic MNF performance. It not only sealed the comeback win over Doug, but it vaulted him from the bottom of the lowest tier of scorers all the way into the middle tier, securing 1 League Cup Point from seemingly nothing. Blake and Matt & Ross both remain very much in contention for the Cup with their 3 Points.</p>
        <p>Unlike in the Playoff Standings, we've already seen some pretty extreme stratification in the FHLC Table. The top 3 franchises have racked up 7 League Cup Points while the bottom 3 franchises have 1 League Cup Point. That 6 Point differential is the equivalent of 2 full weeks, and will soon become difficult to surmount if things don't change. It seems crucial to at least lock up 1 Point per week to keep yourself in the race.</p>

        <p>Looking back on the Modern Era, a different franchise would have won the Playoff Championship and League Cup in every season except for one.</p>
        <p>We've already got Scott & James and Doug at the top of the Standings and Table, respectively. If one of them pulls off the impressive Double, the Community Shield would have to take the runner-up to the League Cup.</p>
        <p>The Shield gives the league a meaningful game prior to #RivalryWeek and adds an even larger reward to the participants. The two qualifiers will each have won a Major Competition of their own in the prior season. This game is sort of like the ultimate championship game since the participants will have gone through the League Cup Table and the MWM qualification and Stage victory just to reach this game.</p>

        <p>Background: A "Super Cup" is a competition in European soccer which often forms the "curtain-raiser" to a season. It is typically contested by two competition winners of the previous season: the knock-out cup winner and the league winner.</p>
        <p>In English soccer, the FA Community Shield is a Super Cup between the EPL Table winner (which would be the Finch Howe League Cup champion for us) and the FA Cup (which would be the MWM Stage winner for us).</p>
        <p>The wording can get really dicey, so don't worry about all of that if it's confusing. Just win this year's Playoff Championship or Finch Howe League Cup to gain entry into the 2020 Community Shield.</p>

<h2>Week 3 Storylines</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>Kamara's 35.3 points is the 3rd best RB performance in Kmish franchise history. It's just behind Zac Stacy's 36.6 in week 9 of 2013.</p></li>
    <li><p>Only once before in Kmish franchise history has a WR broken the 40 point threshold. That was Demaryius Thomas' 44.0 in week 5 of 2014. Keenan Allen opened the flood games again this weekend with 43.0</p></li>
    <li><p>Mitch gets his seventh weekly high-score since the institution of a weekly high score bonus in 2017, and his league-leading 15th since 2011.</p></li>
    <li><p>Teams averaged 133.1 PPG this week. That's the second highest scoring week of the Modern Era, trailing only week 12 of '18 (134.6 PPG)</p></li>
    <li><p>Mitch and Joseph & Mike combined for 339.2 points, making it the third highest scoring game of the Modern Era.</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 4</h2>
<br></br>
<p>It's a stratification week for the Playoff Standings, although no franchise seems like it's in a must-win situation yet.</p>
<p>Nick & Mickey should rebound nicely with great individual matchups across their roster, giving them a real shot at another 3 League Cup Point week. They'll also likely get a head-to-head win over RTRO after being supremely unlucky in last week's loss.</p> 
<p>If Kyle beats Doug, we'll get to read about the last time Doug lost consecutive games in next week's article. The Kyle franchise is making a nice push in the FHLC Table and catches Doug with Kittle on a bye. This is the perfect spot for DTTW to register a solid week.</p>
<p>There's a surprising amount of Thursday Night action in the Matt & Ross vs Scott & James matchup. And then it'll all come down to JuJu on Monday Night Football. Can TPC go 4-0 in "the month of Scott & James"? Or do the Butlers reel our only 3-0 franchise back into the quagmire of defeated teams.</p>
<p>ZJs vs Kmish is a battle at the bottom of the League Cup Table. The ZJs face their second blue-blood program in as many weeks, and will need a ton from their big 3 (Kyler, Kelce, Conner) to overcome the utter beatdown of MIA Keenan Allen is about to administer. Keenan Allen and Alvin Kamara are coming off a couple of the top performances in Kmish franchise history in a huge win over RTRO last week. Can the momentum be sustained?</p>
<p>The Mitch franchise leads the league in scoring and is top of the FHLC Table this week. The Gray franchise offers almost no resistance this week. I said that nobody seemed to be in a must-win situation already, but if any franchise is close it's gotta be the Crockett franchise. It's tough to see anything other than a head-to-head loss and 0 League Cup Points for Crockett's eclectic Saquon-less roster. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse after one of the more painfully bad drafts in recent memory.</p>
<p>We said last week that TBH had 0 wins against teams scoring 100+, and lots of wins against teams scoring 99-. Mitch's Patty Mahomes gauranteed that he would score 100+ last week ... he did, and he won. The blueprint is officially out on TBH. Lamar Jackson feels like a similar situation for Blake this week against TBH. Again, 100+ points is TBH kryptonite.</p>
