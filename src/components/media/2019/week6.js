                        <h1>Week 6</h1>
                        <h3>Evers Family atop the Playoff Standings and FHLC Table</h3>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p>Joseph & Mike have fielded the most formidable roster in the league, averaging 142.7 PPG. That also happens to be their highest PPG to start a season in franchise history. We talked about the 140+ PPG "Diamond Season" in the 2018 Season Review article ... well TBH is on pace as we approach the halfway mark of the regular season. They've also been torching their FHLC Table with yet another 3 Points this week.</p> 
<p>Keeping it in the family, DTTW is off to by far the best start in franchise history. Its 135.8 PPG is the best through five weeks since putting up 126.8 PPG back in 2014. It also squeaked out an epic #RivalryWeek win over RTRO on the back of Deshaun Watson's new all-time DTTW QB scoring record of 56.2. Prior to this week, the only time Kyle had ever gotten a 50+ QB performance was from Peyton Manning in 2013. It's now the first time since '13 that DTTW is in the top-2 of the Standings coming out of week 5, and the first time placing higher than 6th post-#RivalryWeek during the Modern Era.</p>

<br></br>
<p>After being victims of Blake's Super Sweep of #RivalryWeek last season, Scott & James were able to rebound with a resounding 56.6 point victory. In addition to the head-to-head win, they secured 3 League Cup Points which keeps them within 1 game's reach of TBH's 13 League Cup Points.</p>

<br></br>
<p>Last week's article covered the Doug franchise's recent slide. It's built to a 3-game losing streak and continues to worsen. It hasn't been this bad since Doug's disgraceful 2016 Sacko run.</p>
<p>Another big storyline this week are the two traditional powers who meet in a Playoff elimination game this week. RTRO and Crockett both sit at 1-4. Remember that only 1 of the 14 teams to ever begin a season with 1-4 records has made the playoffs (that was Kmish last season). 0 of 7 teams who started 1-5 have made the playoffs. The winner of RTRO vs Crockett is the definition of "must win".</p>

<h3>Major Competitions</h3>
<p>The best way of visualizing the four competitions is by visiting the <a href="/competitions">competitions</a> page on a non-mobile device. We have a Playoff Championship <i id="icons" class="fas fa-star"></i>, Marathon <i id="icons" class="fas fa-award"></i>, League Cup <i id="icons" class="fas fa-trophy"></i>, and a Community Shield <i id="icons" class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i>.</p>
<p>'@bot commands' or '@bot help' will always give you a list of commands and competitions if you forget something.</p>

            <h5>Week 6</h5>
            <p>Joseph & Mike are used to being at the top of the Standings by now. They've got the 3rd most weeks in 1st place. But it's DTTW that finds itself in uncharted territory, having been in the top 2 of the Standings for only 11 weeks in franchise history. Contrast that to TBH who has been #1 for 23 weeks now in its short franchise history.</p>
            <p>Scott & James round out the top tier of 4-1 teams after reaping the rewards of "The Month of TPC" and finally winning against Blake.</p>
            <p>A nice tier of 3-2 franchies has formed which includes the familiar names of Mitch, Matt & Ross, and Kfish. Mitch's total-points tie-breaker advantage from last week has evaporated. Kmish is riding a 3-game winning streak while Matt & Ross find themselves on a 2-game W streak.</p>
            <p>In the next tier of 2-3 teams we find one of the top-scoring franchises in the league - Nick & Mickey and their 141.1 PPG (!!!). They've scored more than 143 points in each of the past four weeks, yet have an extremely unlucky 2-2 record over that span. On the flip side, ZJs have only scored more than 120 points twice this season, and they were fortunate enough to win both of those matchups.</p>
            <p>The bottom tier of sadness includes a genuine historical outlier that we'll get to in the weekly recap later in the article. But suffice to say, a loss this week for any of these franchises will relegate them to the 2019 Consolation Ladder.</p>

        <h5>Week 6</h5>
        <p>Although the Nick & Mickey franchise has been super unlucky in its head-to-head matchups, it's been racking up the FHLC Points. Sitting at 10 League Cup points and 3rd in the Table, Nick & Mickey remain only 3 Points off being top of the Table. This is the FHLC format at its best.</p>
        <p>Scott & James are also trying to keep pace with TBH as Joseph & Mike try to run away with their own League Cup already. Kyle and Mitch both sit at 8 League Cup Points which puts them solidly in the upper-middle of the Table.</p>
        <p>Similar to the Nick & Mickey franchise, RTRO has logged a good amount of FHLC Points while getting nothing to show for head-to-head matchups. RTRO's 6 League Cup Points lead 3-2 teams like Kfish and Doug, and only trail The Butlers by 1 Point. It's conceivable that RTRO could start the season 1-5, yet lead three 4-2 teams on the FHLC Table.</p>
        <p>Blake is actually in a decent position on 4 Points right now. If we had relegation, Gaudet & Cameron and Crockett would be on the hot seat right now.</p>

<h2>Storylines from Last Week</h2>
<br></br>
<ul>
    <li><p>The most PPG-against during the first 5 weeks of a season in the Modern Era was 140.7 PPG ('18 TPC). The most PPG-against through the first 5 weeks of a season in any season was 154.8 ('13 Doug).</p></li>
    <li><p>BLAKE HAS FACED 155.0 PPG-AGAINST. Welcome to the history books Blake! The all-time record for most PPG-against for a full season is 136.0, so there will be a strong mean reversion over the coming weeks to provide some reprieve.</p></li>
    <li><p>The league averaged 137.3 PPG during last week. That's the highest scoring week of the Modern Era ('18 week 12: 135.5 PPG), and the 6th highest scoring week in recorded history.</p></li>
    <li><p>Kyle vs RTRO generated the #13 highest scoring matchup of all-time (328.9 combined points) and Joseph & Mike vs Nick & Mickey the #17 highest scoring matchup (325.1)</p></li>
    <li><p>The Kyle franchise has five wins by a margin of 2.x points. The closest win in franchise history was by 2.1 points. Kyle beat RTRO by 2.2 points in week 5 last year and 2.9 points in week 5 this year.</p></li>
    <li><p>Brett Maher made a 30 yard FG at the end of the Cowboys game that was nullified by a false start. He missed the next kick. That's a -4 point swing in two plays. RTRO started Maher and lost by less than 3 points.</p></li>
    <li><p>Kfish beat Doug 121.4 - 119.5 .. the 1.9 point margin of victory goes down as his #4 closest win in franchise history. The last time the Kmish franchise won a game by less than 3 points was in 2015.</p></li>
    <li><p>The Kmish win required an all-time great D/ST performance. His 35.0 points from the Eagles D/ST was best in franchise history, surpassing his Bears' 28.0 point performance in week 9 of last season.</p></li>
    <li><p>I guess that makes for back-to-back-to-back hearbreaking Monday Night Football losses for the Doug franchise now?</p></li>
    <li><p>Nick & Mickey and Joseph & Mike are each currently on pace for a 140 PPG "Diamond Season"</p></li>
    <li><p>The Crockett franchise has yet to score 115 points this season.</p></li>
    <li><p>Matt & Ross played Crockett in the 2013 semi-finals. The game turned into an instant classic when The Butlers beat Crockett 157.7 - 148.0 by way of Jamaal Charles' otherworldly 59.9 points. McCaffrey just put up the #2 RB performance in Matt & Ross franchise history this week. Against Crockett, again. An absurd number of points, again. 48.0</p></li>
    <li><p> ... McCaffrey's 42.9 points in week 1 was the third best RB performance in Matt & Ross franchise history.</p></li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<h2>Week 6 Matchups</h2>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Matt & Ross vs Mitch:</h5> A battle of 3-2 teams. The winner will take the first step in separating themself into the playoff contender tier. This game is filled with incredible matchups across the board. There's no way Carolina uses CMC the same way they used him against TB last time, right? Lets see if The Butlers can pull a rabbit out of their head again this week.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Gaudet & Cameron vs Doug:</h5> If ZJs sneak up an pull out a win in this matchup, they'll 3-3 and in the thick of things. On the other side, Doug will have gone on a 4 game losing streak and be tenuously positioned at 2-4. Arguably the most important objective this week is for Doug to collect some League Cup Points. This franchise sits in the bottom half of the Table, but isn't out of contention -yet-.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Kyle vs Nick & Mickey:</h5> Two of the top teams in the league, and both are on red-hot scoring tears. Nick & Mickey need this head-to-head win a lot more than Kyle does for the Playoff Standings, but they find themselves AHEAD of Kyle by 2 Points in the FHLC Table. It wouldn't be surprising at all to see both of these teams produce at least 1 League Cup Point this week. A 3 Point performance from Nick & Mickey coupled with a down week from TBH will thrust Nick & Mickey to the top of the Table.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Scott & James vs Joseph & Mike:</h5> Both of these franchises are 4-1. They're #1 and #2 in the League Cup Table. They're #1 and #3 in the Playoff Standings. There's a long way to go, but whoever emerges with the win will start to have their sights on a Playoff BYE already.</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Crockett vs RTRO:</h5> This is a battle of 1-4 teams, and the simple summary is that the loser of this game will not make the Playoffs. Both are off to franchise-worst starts. These two are tied for the most playoff appearances in league history, so not having one or both of them in the playoffs this year opens the door for a newcomer or two (looking at DTTW and TPC).</p>
<br></br>
<p><h5>Kfish vs Blake:</h5> Kfish has completely turned things around after a scary 0-2 start. Blake has gone 1-4 after facing the most brutal 5 game stretch in the history of fantasy (an all-time worst 155.0 PPG-against, as mentioned earlier), but that's totally unsustainable. Could this be the week that Blake finally catches a break, or does Kmish handle business and eliminate Blake from the Playoffs as a consequence? Blake has scored an extremely respectable 127+ in three of five weeks, so this isn't your typical 1-4 roster.</p>
